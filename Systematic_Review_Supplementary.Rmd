## Appendix A: Search Strategy Details

### A.1 Initial Naive Search Results
- Web of Science: 97 records
- Scopus: 105 records
- ProQuest: 47 records
- Total: 249 records

### A.2 Litsearchr Network Analysis
Using the litsearchr package in R, we conducted keyword co-occurrence network analysis on the 249 initial records. The analysis identified 25 high-importance search terms based on network strength (weighted degree centrality) using an 80/20 Pareto cutoff.

### A.3 Optimized Search Results
**Final Search String:**
((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robber* OR dealer*) AND ("choic* model*" OR "discret* choic*" OR "ration* choic*" OR "spatial* choic*" OR mobil*) AND (pattern* OR "locat* choic*" OR "target* select*"))

**Database Results:**
- Web of Science: 681 records
- Scopus: 1,169 records
- ProQuest: 189 records
- Google Scholar: 286 records
- Total: 2,325 records
- After deduplication: 1,674 unique records
- Duplicates removed: 651 (28.0%)

### A.4 Gold Standard Validation
The search strategy was validated against 41 known relevant articles representing core literature in crime location choice research. The gold standard included seminal works such as:

- "A discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection at the house-level"
- "Where offenders choose to attack: a discrete choice model of robberies in Chicago"  
- "Graffiti writers choose locations that optimize exposure"
- "Go where the money is: modeling street robbers' location choices"
- "Effects of attractiveness, opportunity and accessibility to burglars on residential burglary rates"

**Validation Results:**
- Gold standard articles: 41
- Articles successfully retrieved: 41 (100% recall)
- False negatives: 0
- Search performance: Perfect recall with maintained precision

**Final Dataset Composition:**
- Gold standard articles included: 41 studies
- Additional relevant studies identified: 8 studies  
- Multi-country study contributing additional observations: 1 study (3 countries, +2 observations)
- Total final dataset: 49 studies, 51 observations

This demonstrates that our optimized search strategy achieved perfect recall for known relevant literature while successfully identifying additional high-quality studies that expanded our evidence base beyond expert-known articles.

## Detailed Screening Stage Results

### Title and Abstract Screening (Combined)
- **Records screened**: 1,667 (after removing 7 additional duplicates and other language articles)
- **Records excluded**: 1,583
  - **Title screening exclusions**: 1,338
  - **Abstract screening exclusions**: 245
- **Records retained for full-text assessment**: 84

### Full-Text Assessment
- **Reports sought for retrieval**: 84
- **Reports not retrieved**: 4
- **Reports assessed for eligibility**: 80
- **Reports excluded**: 31
  - **Insufficient spatial detail**: 20
  - **Offender residence studies**: 10
  - **No discrete choice models**: 8
- **Studies included in final review**: 49

### Inter-rater Reliability
Cohen's kappa was calculated for each screening stage:
- Title/Abstract screening: κ = 0.89
- Full-text assessment: κ = 1.00 (perfect agreement)
