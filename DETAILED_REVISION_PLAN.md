# Detailed Action Plan for Paper Revision
## Point-by-Point Response to Reviewer Comments

### REVIEWER 1 RESPONSES

#### **Comment 1.1: Misconception of Aesthetic Hierarchies**
> "The authors base much of their analysis on a presumed hierarchy of aesthetic quality among graffiti styles..."

**Response Strategy:**
```
We acknowledge this fundamental criticism and thank the reviewer for pointing out this important cultural misunderstanding. We have revised our theoretical framework to replace the concept of "aesthetic quality hierarchy" with "aesthetic complexity spectrum" following Ferrell & Weide's original formulation. We now recognize that tags, while simpler to execute, can represent sophisticated artistic expression and subcultural capital (Chastanet, 2007; Baldini, 2008). Our revised analysis focuses on functional differences between graffiti forms rather than value judgments about quality.
```

**Manuscript Changes:**
- Replace all instances of "quality" with "complexity" or "form"
- Add citations: Chastanet (2007), Baldini (2008)
- Rewrite introduction to acknowledge cultural nuance
- Revise hypothesis to focus on functional clustering rather than quality competition

#### **Comment 1.2: Inappropriate Inclusion of Street Art**
> "The inclusion of stencils and other forms of street art in the dataset is a critical flaw."

**Response Strategy:**
```
We acknowledge this methodological concern. To address this, we have conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding stencils from our SITS category and analyzing only traditional graffiti forms (tags, throw-ups, pieces). We present results both with and without stencils to demonstrate the robustness of our findings. We recognize that community validation would have been valuable for determining appropriate categorizations and acknowledge this as a significant limitation.
```

**Required Analysis:**
- Re-run MHI analysis excluding stencils
- Create new results tables/figures
- Compare results with and without stencils
- Add methodological note about community validation

#### **Comment 1.3: Risk as Primary Determinant**
> "High-risk areas typically attract tags; medium-risk areas may allow for throw-ups; low-risk areas are suitable for pieces."

**Response Strategy:**
```
We agree that risk calibration represents a compelling alternative explanation for our findings. Our observed clustering patterns are equally compatible with risk-based site selection as with aesthetic considerations. We have revised our discussion to present risk assessment as a primary mechanism, with aesthetic considerations as a potential secondary factor. Future research should explicitly measure risk factors (surveillance, foot traffic, escape routes) to disentangle these mechanisms.
```

**Manuscript Changes:**
- Add risk calibration as primary alternative explanation in introduction
- Revise discussion to emphasize risk over aesthetic competition
- Acknowledge limitation in not measuring risk factors
- Suggest future research directions

#### **Comment 1.4: Lack of Ethnographic Engagement**
> "the absence of any engagement with the local graffiti community"

**Response Strategy:**
```
We acknowledge this as our study's most significant limitation. The absence of community engagement represents a fundamental methodological shortcoming that limits our ability to accurately interpret spatial patterns. We recommend that future research prioritize collaborative approaches with graffiti communities to validate categorizations, understand local cultural logics, and ensure that spatial analyses reflect practitioners' actual decision-making processes.
```

**Manuscript Changes:**
- Move community engagement limitation to prominent early position
- Acknowledge throughout paper where community input would have been valuable
- Revise claims to be more tentative about writer motivations
- Add future research recommendations for community collaboration

### REVIEWER 2 RESPONSES

#### **Comment 2.1: Methodological Approach Issues**
> "the methodological approach is not really measuring what it is supposed to"

**Response Strategy:**
```
We acknowledge that our data collection focused on form and placement rather than aesthetic characteristics per se. We have reframed our study as examining spatial clustering of graffiti forms with different complexity levels and functional purposes, rather than aesthetic quality. This reframing better aligns our methodology with our actual measurements while acknowledging the limitations of visual categorization without community validation.
```

#### **Comment 2.2: Scientific References**
> "there is not enough scientific references used"

**Response Strategy:**
```
We have substantially expanded our literature review to include the suggested references and additional scholarly work on graffiti aesthetics, subcultural studies, and spatial analysis. We particularly thank the reviewer for suggesting Chamberlain et al. (2022) and the Routledge handbook, which have strengthened our theoretical grounding.
```

**Required Action:**
- Add suggested references: Chamberlain et al. (2022), Ross (Ed.) Routledge handbook, Zaimakis et al.
- Expand literature review section
- Integrate new perspectives throughout manuscript

#### **Comment 2.3: Need for Visual Documentation**
> "very surprised not to see any photos of the graffiti data itself"

**Response Strategy:**
```
We have added photographic examples of each graffiti category to help readers understand our classification system. These images illustrate the complexity differences between forms while avoiding value judgments about quality. We acknowledge that community validation of these categorizations would have strengthened our methodology.
```

**Required Action:**
- Select representative photos for each category
- Add figure with photo examples
- Include discussion of visual categorization challenges

### REVIEWER 3 RESPONSES

#### **Comment 3.1: Theoretical Framework Context**
> "Spot theory is originally based on Ferrell's ethnographic research on the male-dominated graffiti subculture in Denver, thus in a U.S. context."

**Response Strategy:**
```
We thank the reviewer for highlighting the cultural and geographic specificity of spot theory's origins. We have added discussion of how local contexts (including Ghent's graffiti policies, enforcement practices, and subcultural norms) may affect the applicability of theories developed in other settings. We also acknowledge the gendered assumptions in some graffiti research and cite more diverse perspectives.
```

#### **Comment 3.2: Alternative Hypothesis**
> "My question is, if the hypothesis is formulated right or if, for example the hypothesis presented on p. 15 is more fit"

**Response Strategy:**
```
We agree that site suitability represents a more parsimonious explanation for our findings than aesthetic competition. We have revised our primary hypothesis to focus on differential site requirements and risk tolerances, with aesthetic considerations as a secondary factor. This reframing better aligns with the spatial ecology literature and avoids problematic assumptions about subcultural hierarchies.
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

The revision will be successful if it:
1. **Respects subcultural knowledge** while maintaining analytical rigor
2. **Provides robust alternative explanations** for observed patterns
3. **Acknowledges limitations** honestly and prominently
4. **Suggests concrete steps** for community-engaged future research
5. **Maintains empirical contribution** while avoiding cultural misrepresentation

This approach transforms the reviewers' criticisms into opportunities for a more nuanced, culturally informed, and methodologically robust contribution to the literature.
