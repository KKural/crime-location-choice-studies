# Comprehensive Strategy for Addressing Reviewer Feedback
## "Choosing the right pond: Street graffiti clusters by aesthetic quality"

### OVERVIEW OF MAIN ISSUES

The three reviewers raise several interconnected concerns that require fundamental revisions:

1. **Theoretical Misinterpretation**: Misunderstanding of aesthetic hierarchies in graffiti culture
2. **Methodological Issues**: Inclusion of non-graffiti street art and lack of community validation
3. **Alternative Explanations**: Risk calibration as primary driver rather than aesthetic competition
4. **Lack of Cultural Context**: Absence of ethnographic engagement with graffiti community

## DETAILED RESPONSE STRATEGY

### 1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK REVISION

#### **Issue**: Misconception of aesthetic hierarchies
**Reviewer 1**: "The authors base much of their analysis on a presumed hierarchy of aesthetic quality among graffiti styles, where pieces are considered high quality, SITS medium, and tags low. This hierarchy is taken as internal to the graffiti subculture, yet this assumption is deeply misleading."

**Response Strategy**:
- **Reframe from "quality" to "complexity"**: Follow Ferrell & Weide's original formulation
- **Acknowledge cultural nuance**: Recognize that tags can represent artistic mastery
- **Revise hypothesis**: Focus on aesthetic complexity rather than hierarchical quality
- **Add citations**: Include Chastanet, Baldini, and other graffiti culture scholars

#### **Proposed Revision**:
```
OLD: "aesthetic quality hierarchy with masterpieces at the top, tags at the bottom"
NEW: "aesthetic complexity spectrum, recognizing that different forms serve different purposes and demonstrate different skills within graffiti culture"
```

### 2. METHODOLOGICAL REFINEMENT

#### **Issue**: Inappropriate inclusion of street art
**Reviewer 1**: "The inclusion of stencils and other forms of street art in the dataset is a critical flaw."

**Response Strategy**:
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Re-run analysis excluding stencils
- **Separate analysis**: Analyze traditional graffiti (tags, throw-ups, pieces) separately from street art
- **Cultural validation**: Acknowledge need for community input on categorization
- **Transparency**: Present results both with and without contested categories

#### **Issue**: Risk calibration as alternative explanation
**Reviewer 1**: "High-risk areas typically attract tags; medium-risk areas may allow for throw-ups; low-risk areas are suitable for pieces."

**Response Strategy**:
- **Acknowledge limitation**: Recognize risk as potentially primary driver
- **Reframe findings**: Present clustering as compatible with both risk and aesthetic considerations
- **Future research**: Suggest studies that can disentangle these mechanisms
- **Nuanced interpretation**: Avoid claiming aesthetic competition as sole explanation

### 3. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT

#### **Issue**: Lack of ethnographic grounding
**All Reviewers**: Various forms of "absence of engagement with local graffiti communities"

**Response Strategy**:
- **Acknowledge limitation prominently**: Move this from limitations to early in paper
- **Collaborate with community**: If possible, conduct follow-up interviews
- **Literature integration**: Incorporate more ethnographic graffiti studies
- **Humble claims**: Avoid definitive statements about writer motivations

### 4. CONTEXTUAL GROUNDING

#### **Issue**: Lack of local context
**Reviewer 3**: "stronger discussion on the sampling procedure and argumentation for how the three aesthetic categories are formed"

**Response Strategy**:
- **Add Ghent context**: Describe local graffiti policy, legal walls, enforcement
- **Visual documentation**: Include photos of each category
- **Policy landscape**: Discuss how local context affects patterns
- **Generalizability**: Address limitations of single-city study

## SPECIFIC REVISION PRIORITIES

### HIGH PRIORITY (Essential for acceptance)
1. **Reframe theoretical foundation** from aesthetic quality to complexity/function
2. **Conduct sensitivity analysis** excluding stencils
3. **Acknowledge risk calibration** as primary alternative explanation
4. **Add visual documentation** of graffiti categories
5. **Strengthen limitations section** regarding lack of community engagement

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important for credibility)
1. **Expand literature review** with ethnographic graffiti studies
2. **Add local context** about Ghent's graffiti scene
3. **Refine methodology section** with better justification for categories
4. **Include policy implications** that respect subcultural autonomy

### LOW PRIORITY (Enhancement)
1. **Future research directions** emphasizing community collaboration
2. **Theoretical contributions** to spatial analysis of subcultures
3. **International comparisons** with other cities

## SAMPLE REVISED SECTIONS

### New Introduction Paragraph
```
"While previous research has examined graffiti location patterns through the lens of visibility and risk (Ferrell & Weide, 2010), less attention has been paid to how different forms of graffiti—each serving distinct subcultural functions—might spatially cluster. Rather than assuming a hierarchical ranking of aesthetic 'quality,' we approach graffiti forms as representing different levels of complexity, time investment, and subcultural purpose. Tags, though requiring minimal time, represent the fundamental expression of graffiti culture and can demonstrate considerable artistic skill (Chastanet, 2007). Pieces require extended time and elaborate planning but serve different communicative functions. We hypothesize that these functional differences, combined with varying risk tolerances and site requirements, may lead to spatial clustering patterns."
```

### Revised Hypothesis Section
```
"We hypothesize that graffiti forms cluster spatially not due to aesthetic competition per se, but due to a combination of factors including: (1) differential risk tolerances associated with time requirements, (2) varying site suitability for different forms, and (3) potential subcultural norms regarding appropriate spatial contexts for different expressions. This clustering may manifest as reduced co-occurrence of different graffiti forms within the same street segments."
```

### Enhanced Limitations
```
"Our study has several important limitations. Most critically, we did not engage with the local graffiti community to validate our categorizations or interpretations. This represents a significant methodological limitation that could have been addressed through ethnographic methods, interviews with practitioners, or collaborative research approaches. Without community input, our interpretation of spatial patterns risks misrepresenting the cultural logics that actually drive location choices."
```

## POTENTIAL COLLABORATIONS

Consider reaching out to:
1. **Local graffiti researchers** in Belgium/Netherlands
2. **Cultural ethnographers** who study urban subcultures
3. **Community organizations** that work with graffiti writers
4. **Legal graffiti spaces** in Ghent for community connections

## CONCLUSION

While the reviewer feedback is challenging, it provides an opportunity to strengthen the paper significantly. The core empirical finding (spatial clustering) remains valuable, but needs reframing within a more culturally informed and theoretically nuanced framework. The key is to maintain the quantitative contribution while acknowledging its limitations and avoiding cultural misrepresentation.
