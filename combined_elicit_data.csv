This could affect the representativeness of the sample.
- **Causal Inference:** The study does not explicitly address limitations in establishing causality, but the reliance on recorded crime data and assumptions about offender behavior may introduce challenges in inferring causal relationships.
- **Generalizability:** The study is limited to the Belgian province of East Flanders, which may not be representative of other regions or countries. The focus on houses rather than apartments also limits generalizability to other types of dwellings.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not provide direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods, which could limit its applicability to other settings.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are specific to the study area in East Flanders, Belgium, and may not apply to other regions with different demographic and environmental characteristics.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on burglars in East Flanders, which may not be representative of all burglars or burglary patterns in other areas.","- ""This study sought to answer which house attributes influence burglars' decision when selecting a target.""
  - ""The key advantage of our study is that this process was modeled for the first time at its ultimate outcome; that is, the house that is eventually burglarized.""

  - ""Second, like previous crime location choice studies this study did not explicitly acknowledge that offender's consideration with regard to crime site selection apply to multiple levels of spatial aggregation.""
  - ""Testing such models involves applying a variation of the nested logit model""
  - ""Finally, future applications could study burglars' cost and benefit balancing process in detail by investigating the presence of interaction effects between attributes of reward, effort and risk.""",NA,"- Theoretical Contributions: The study advances crime location choice theory by modeling the target selection process at the house level, which is a finer spatial resolution than previous studies (Quotes 1, 2).
- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that policy should focus on effort-related attributes, such as distance from the offender's home and ease of access (Quote 3).
- Crime Prevention Implications: The study implies that crime prevention strategies should target houses that are easily accessible and close to potential offenders' homes (Quote 3).
- Urban Planning Implications: The study suggests that urban planning should consider the layout and accessibility of residential areas to reduce burglary opportunities (Quote 3).
- Policy Recommendations: The study recommends focusing on effort-related attributes in policy and practice (Quote 3).
- Future Research Directions: The authors suggest further research on house-level data, exploring multiple levels of spatial aggregation, and investigating interaction effects between attributes (Quotes 6, 7, 8, 9).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study suggests using finer spatial units, such as the house level, for future research (Quote 2).
- Data Collection Suggestions: The authors recommend exploring additional house-level data sources, such as land registers or insurance companies (Quote 7).
- Methodological Improvements: The study suggests using variations of the nested logit model to account for multiple levels of spatial aggregation (Quote 9).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study has implications for understanding how burglars select targets, which can inform broader societal strategies for crime prevention (Quote 3).
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects to urban planning and policy by suggesting that these fields should consider the spatial layout and accessibility of residential areas (Quote 3)."

- **Geographic Limitations:** The study is limited to the greater The Hague area in the Netherlands, which may not be representative of other regions (implied by the focus on this specific area).
- **Model Limitations:** The study uses discrete choice models, which assume offenders choose locations based on expected utility, but it does not account for other decision-making processes (Quote 6).
- **Analytical Constraints:** The study cannot empirically distinguish between different explanations for the findings due to data limitations (Quote 5).","- ""Although the present study offers important insights into offenders' spatiotemporal criminal decision-making, some caveats and opportunities for future research should be mentioned. First, this study relies on police data regarding arrested offenders. As only a proportion of all crimes are solved by the police, the results from this study might suffer from detection bias.""
  - ""The question remains whether we can generalize our findings to nonarrested offenders because there might be differences in the probability of arrest between first offenders and offenders who committed multiple offenses in the same area.""
  - ""However, recent research suggests that detection bias is not as large as has often been assumed in previous literature (Johnson et al. 2009;Lammers 2014;Summers, Johnson, and Rengert 2010). These studies found little evidence that solved and unsolved offenses display large spatiotemporal differences.""
  - ""the fact that our offender population was arrested for offenses committed at a certain place and time might seem contradicting to our predictions based on rational choice and crime pattern theory.""
  - ""Another possible explanation for why offenders return to previously targeted areas even if they were arrested could be that those that got caught reduce their sanction certainty estimate based on a belief that they would have had to be exceedingly unlucky to get arrested.""
  - ""our hypotheses are built on the assumption that offenders actively learn about suitable targets at particular times and days and that they subsequently use this information in their future spatiotemporal criminal decisionmaking. However, we did not explicitly test such an underlying ""state dependence"" mechanism, and other explanations for our findings are also possible.""
  - ""Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to distinguish between these different types of explanations, and hence, we could not empirically assess the extent to which these other mechanisms might explain our findings.""
  - ""the main finding of our study emphasizes that the understudied role of time of day and part of week in crime location choice studies deserves more attention. Extending crime pattern theory by adding a cyclic time dimension to awareness spaces, the present study contributed to the geography of crime literature by stressing that offenders' knowledge about potential risks, rewards, and opportunities could no longer be conceptualized as completely time-invariant.""",NA,"- **Sample Limitations:** The study relies on police data regarding arrested offenders, which may suffer from detection bias since not all crimes are solved by the police. This could limit the representativeness of the sample.
- **Causal Inference:** The study does not explicitly test the underlying mechanism of how offenders learn about suitable targets, which could limit the ability to establish causality between the timing of offenses and crime location choices.
- **Generalizability:** The findings may not generalize to nonarrested offenders due to potential differences in the probability of arrest. However, recent research suggests that detection bias may not be as significant as previously thought.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not provide direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods, which could limit the ability to generalize findings to other settings.
- **Context Specificity:** The study's findings are based on data from the Netherlands, which may have specific cultural, legal, or environmental factors that could affect the generalizability of the results to other contexts.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on repeat offenders, which may not be representative of all offenders, particularly first-time offenders or those who do not commit multiple offenses in the same area.","- ""This study contributes to the geography of crime research in three ways. First, we extend Brantingham and Brantingham's (1981;2008) crime pattern theory by arguing that offender awareness spaces are not static over the week or day but rather time-specific.""
  - ""These results are not only important for how we should think about the time specificity of offenders' awareness spaces and how this provides a better explanation of their crime location choices.""
  - ""Our findings show that the likelihood to return to previously targeted areas is actually increased at similar days of the week and similar times of the day, whereas most predictive policing applications do not take such cyclic time effects into account but merely rely on spatial and temporal decay functions.""
  - ""our findings imply that also time-specific situational preventive measures that make a targeted area less attractive on similar days and times of previous crimes could help preventing future crime in that area (e.g., improve lighting in an area that was targeted at night).""
  - ""Although the present study offers important insights into offenders' spatiotemporal criminal decision-making, some caveats and opportunities for future research should be mentioned.""
  - ""future studies could measure which other activity nodes than the ones currently available for research are visited by offenders and when they are usually visited.""
  - ""Future research might also take more direct measures of time-varying target attractiveness into account, for example, by focusing on effects of opening and closing hours of facilities and businesses on crime location choices.""
  - ""To examine time-varying target attractiveness that relate more specifically to certain crime types such as bike theft, car theft, or robbery, future research might also consider carrying out systematic observations to determine variations in, for example, the number of bicycles, motor vehicles, or people in a given area.""",NA,"- The study advances crime location choice theory by introducing the concept of time-specific awareness spaces, which are dynamic and not static over the week or day (Theoretical Contributions).
- The findings suggest that predictive policing methods should incorporate cyclic time effects to better predict repeat offenses (Policy Implications).
- Time-specific situational preventive measures, such as improving lighting in areas targeted at night, can help prevent future crimes (Crime Prevention Implications).

  - ""whether the results presented here reflect the spatial decision-making patterns of non-arrested burglars in ZG city needs to be explored in future studies.""",NA,"- Theoretical Contributions: The study advances crime location choice theory by showing that offenders' spatial crime patterns are based on their non-overlapping activity spaces rather than risk assessments related to appearance (Quote 1). It also supports crime pattern theory by highlighting the role of awareness spaces in target choices (Quote 7).
- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that communities with high crime rates may be due to high offending rates among nonlocal migrants rather than preference for targeting those areas (Quote 2). This has implications for policy targeting these communities.
- Crime Prevention Implications: Understanding that physical and social barriers affect crime location choices can inform crime prevention strategies by focusing on areas with fewer barriers (Quote 6).
- Urban Planning Implications: The study's findings on physical barriers like rivers and roads can inform urban planning to reduce crime by designing spaces that limit criminal mobility (Quote 6).
- Policy Recommendations: The study does not explicitly provide policy recommendations, but the implications suggest focusing on areas with high offending rates and designing urban spaces to limit criminal mobility.
- Future Research Directions: Future studies should explore whether the findings generalize to non-arrested burglars (Quote 8) and address limitations such as temporal mismatches in data (Quote 4) and lack of direct wealth measures (Quote 5).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study does not explicitly mention optimal spatial units or scales, but it suggests considering the impact of physical and social barriers at various scales.
- Data Collection Suggestions: Future studies should aim to include more direct measures of wealth and address temporal mismatches in data collection (Quotes 4 and 5).
- Methodological Improvements: The study suggests improving analytical approaches by including non-arrested burglars and addressing data limitations (Quotes 3 and 8).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study highlights the importance of understanding crime patterns in relation to urban design and social segregation, which has broader implications for societal safety and justice.
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects crime location choice theory with urban planning and sociology, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understand crime patterns."

- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that recording information on areas regularly visited by known offenders could aid in linking unsolved crimes (Quote 4).
- Crime Prevention Implications: The study suggests that securing and monitoring areas frequently visited by potential offenders could reduce crime risk (Quote 5).
- Urban Planning Implications: The findings are relevant for urban planning as they suggest replacing frequently visited activity nodes and securing broader areas to reduce crime (Quote 5).
- Policy Recommendations: The study recommends systematically recording information on areas visited by known offenders and strategically securing these areas (Quotes 4, 5).
- Future Research Directions: The authors suggest conducting research with larger and more diverse offender samples to test the generalizability of findings (Quote 7).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study suggests using more detailed spatial units to capture awareness spaces and travel paths (Quote 9).
- Data Collection Suggestions: The authors recommend using continuous GPS-tracking to gather detailed data on activity nodes and travel routes (Quote 10).
- Methodological Improvements: Future studies should aim to increase the quality and integrality of data on awareness spaces and offense locations (Quote 8).

  - ""The Pseudo R 2 values, ranging from 0.27 to 0.36, indicate a good fit to the data (McFadden, 1973) and are comparable with previous DSCM studies.""",NA,"- **Data Quality Issues:** The paper mentions that the data does not capture all pre-offense activity locations for all offenders, indicating a potential issue with data completeness (Quote 1). Additionally, the method for filling in missing data introduced imprecision (Quote 3), and frequency was likely overestimated for certain activity locations (Quote 4).
- **Missing Data:** The paper notes that not all pre-offense activity locations were captured (Quote 1), and there were issues with missing data that required imputation (Quote 3).
- **Data Source Limitations:** The study used police administrative data, which may have limitations in terms of capturing all relevant activity locations (Quote 8).

- **Temporal Limitations:** The study used data from 2009 to 2018, but there is no specific mention of temporal limitations related to this period.
- **Geographic Limitations:** The study was conducted in New Zealand, but there is no mention of specific geographic limitations within the country.
- **Model Limitations:** The study used discrete choice models, which require a dataset with specific characteristics (Quote 11). Sampling was used to manage computational barriers (Quote 12).

  - ""Another avenue for future research in continuing the empirical investigation of Curtis-Ham et al.'s (2020) model, would be to consider different subgroups of offenders.""
  - ""our results should be interpreted in light of several limitations which illustrate the challenges involved in operationalizing these attributes using police administrative data, within the DSCM paradigm.""
  - ""First, our measures of reliability and relevance-constructed by combining attributes of offenders' activity locations-were proxies for offenders' knowledge; we did not assess their knowledge directly.""
  - ""Second, our method for filling in missing data in the reliability and relevance variables necessarily introduced some imprecision.""
  - ""Considering these sources of error, in drawing conclusions we put more emphasis on the general pattern, seen consistently across the crime types, than the specific effect sizes observed.""",NA,"- **Sample Limitations:** The study uses a large dataset from New Zealand, which is a strength, but the authors suggest that future studies should expand the range of crimes included to further test generalizability. This indicates a limitation in the scope of crimes studied.
- **Causal Inference:** The study uses proxies for offenders' knowledge, which may not directly assess their internal decision-making processes. This could limit the ability to establish causality between activity locations and crime choices.
- **Generalizability:** The study suggests that the findings may generalize beyond the crimes included, but recommends further research to confirm this. The use of a dataset from a previously understudied region supports generalizability across contexts.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not compare across different contexts or time periods explicitly, but suggests that future research should explore these aspects, particularly for crimes influenced by reporting or policing variations.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are based on data from New Zealand, which may have unique characteristics compared to other regions. The study's generalizability to other contexts is supported but requires further testing.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on offenders with identified activity locations, which may not represent all offenders. The authors suggest considering different subgroups of offenders in future research.","- ""The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.""

  - ""the findings demonstrate the salience of a broad range of activity locations to offenders' crime location choices.""
  - ""understanding the combined contribution of reliability and relevance is important for informing predictions about where individual offenders are likely to offend, which in turn can inform crime prevention and investigation strategies.""
  - ""Practitioners conducting geographic profiling (Rossmo, 2000) in police investigations could apply these factors to assess suspects' likelihood of having committed a crime given the location and attributes their nearby activity locations, and prioritize the suspects accordingly""

- The operationalization of opportunity as the number of potential targets (e.g., dwellings for residential burglary, business units for non-residential burglary) directly relates to crime opportunity variables.
- The use of business units as indicators for commercial and personal robbery targets falls under crime attractors and land use.

  - ""The collective efficacy measure was created by Sampson and his colleagues (Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997) and was provided to us for use in this research. The measure is based on a population survey among a neighborhood cluster sample, in which Chicago residents answered questions on the perceived extent of social cohesion and social control in their local communities (for details of the instrument, see Earls et al., 1997).

  - ""The estimation of discrete choice models requires a considerable amount of computer resources when both the number of observations (choices) and the number of alternatives per choice are large.""
  - ""We have also neglected temporal variation. Great places for robbery in the morning may be pretty useless places at night.

The average real estate values in all neighborhoods have increased between 1993 and 1999, but in some neighborhoods they have increased more than in others. In order to obtain an estimated value for all years, we assumed a linear trend in real estate value within neighborhoods, and imputed the values for the years 1996-1998 and for 2000-2001 accordingly. In the analysis, the data of the separate years were averaged.""

This is a common limitation in studies that rely on specific geographic areas for data collection.
- **Causal Inference:** The study uses a discrete choice model, which can help in understanding preferences but may not directly establish causality. The dependency in the data due to reoffending could lead to errors in statistical inference, affecting causal interpretations.
- **Generalizability:** The study extends the external validity by examining a previously unstudied crime type and geographic location, suggesting some generalizability. However, the exclusion of crimes from outside the study area and the focus on a specific type of crime (TFV) might limit generalizability to other contexts.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not provide direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods, which could limit its ability to inform about variations in offender spatial decision making across different settings.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are specific to the context of TFV in Dorset, UK, and may not apply to other types of crimes or locations. The study's focus on a specific geographic area and crime type could make it difficult to generalize findings to other contexts.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on detected incidents of TFV, which might not represent all TFV incidents or offenders. The population constraints are related to the availability of data and the focus on a specific crime type.","- ""The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.""
  - ""The influence of the road network on adult offender spatial decision making is a particularly novel result and this finding, along with those concerned with the impact of routine activity nodes on offender spatial decision making, has potential policy implications for those involved in the development of urban spaces.""
  - ""Conducting a formal crime impact assessment (for a further discussion, see Bowers, 2014; Ekblom, 1997Ekblom, , 2002) ) that is informed by findings such as those presented here would be one way of doing this.""

  - ""Considering the mechanisms through which social cohesion might influence the likelihood of crime occurrence, it may do so either through residents influencing the behavior of others in their neighborhood, or by deterring offenders from targeting a particular neighborhood.""
  - ""Recent studies have begun to explore these issues (e.g., Reynald, 2011;Weisburd et al., 2012), but more research is needed.""

- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that urban planners should consider crime risk when designing urban spaces and road networks (Quotes 2, 3, 4).
- Crime Prevention Implications: The study implies that understanding offender spatial decision-making can inform crime prevention strategies, particularly by considering the impact of urban design on crime risk (Quotes 2, 5).
- Urban Planning Implications: Urban planners should consider the potential crime risk implications of their designs, especially regarding connectivity and the placement of new facilities (Quotes 3, 5).
- Policy Recommendations: Conducting formal crime impact assessments is recommended to inform urban planning decisions (Quote 4).
- Future Research Directions: Future research should explore the role of other routine activity nodes and how collective action varies over time (Quotes 9, 10, 14).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study suggests using smaller spatial units like Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) for analysis (implied by the use of LSOAs in the study).
- Data Collection Suggestions: Future research should collect data on routine activity nodes beyond home locations (Quote 10).
- Methodological Improvements: The study suggests using the discrete choice approach to examine offender decision-making (Quotes 6, 10).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study contributes to understanding how urban design affects crime risk, which has broader implications for community safety and crime prevention (Quotes 2, 3, 5).
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects criminology with urban planning and design, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to crime prevention (Quotes 2, 3, 4)."

- The study area size is not explicitly given in total square kilometers, but it is mentioned that The Hague comprises 89 residential neighborhoods with an average size of 0.65 square kilometers each. This implies a total area of approximately 57.85 square kilometers (89 neighborhoods * 0.65 square kilometers per neighborhood).
- The study area description is that of The Hague, focusing on its residential neighborhoods.
- The primary crime type analyzed is residential burglary, as indicated by the repeated mention of ""residential burglaries"" and ""residential burglars.""
- There are no other crime types mentioned in the paper, so the list of crime types is limited to residential burglary.","- ""The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands.""

- **Causal Inference:** The study assumes that burglaries are profitable, which might not always be the case, especially since only detected (and thus unsuccessful) burglaries are analyzed. This assumption could affect the causal inference about why burglars return to previous target areas.
- **Generalizability:** The study's findings might not generalize to other types of crimes or to different geographical contexts. The focus on burglary only and the use of a specific spatial unit of analysis (LSOAs) could limit generalizability.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study is limited to a specific time period (2007-2012) and does not allow for comparisons across different time periods or contexts.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are specific to the context of the West Midlands in the UK and may not apply to other regions or countries with different socio-economic conditions or policing strategies.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on detected residential burglaries, which may not represent all types of burglaries or offenders, particularly those involved in undetected or unsuccessful burglaries.","- ""Our findings thus present good news for crime pattern theory.

  - ""The theory itself, in particular the awareness space concept and its implications, builds on theoretical and empirical work in behavioral geography""
  - ""The distinction between successful and unsuccessful burglaries is important and future research should therefore assess the extent to which the return of burglars to prior target areas is conditional on the success of the previous burglaries.""

  - ""Another unresolved issue is the potential confounding by patterns of co-offending.""
  - ""As any study that explores the probability of an event as a function of similar prior events, our study suffers from the possibility that unobserved heterogeneity is attributed to state dependent variables.""
  - ""Finally, returning to the observation that human behavior in space is remarkably regular and predictable, we believe to have tentatively demonstrated that this consistency also applies to burglars and the locations they commit burglaries.""
  - ""Future research will hopefully teach us under which conditions this consistency is violated, and why.""",NA,"- Theoretical Contributions: The study advances crime location choice theory by supporting the awareness space concept within crime pattern theory, which is linked to behavioral geography.
- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that understanding the recency and spatial proximity of past burglaries can inform policing strategies, although specific policy implications are not detailed.
- Crime Prevention Implications: The study implies that targeting areas with recent burglary history could be effective in preventing future burglaries.
- Urban Planning Implications: The study does not explicitly mention urban planning implications, but the focus on spatial patterns could suggest relevance for urban design in terms of crime prevention.
- Policy Recommendations: The paper does not provide specific policy recommendations but suggests future research should consider the success of previous burglaries and co-offending patterns.
- Future Research Directions: Future research should assess the impact of successful vs. unsuccessful burglaries on repeat offending and consider co-offending patterns.
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study uses LSOAs as spatial units, but no specific recommendations for future spatial scales are provided.
- Data Collection Suggestions: The paper suggests the need for offender-based research to measure same-offender involvement in different types of burglaries.
- Methodological Improvements: The study notes the potential for unobserved heterogeneity and suggests future research should address this.
- Broader Societal Implications: The study highlights the predictability of human behavior in space, which has broader implications for understanding criminal behavior.
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects to behavioral geography, indicating an interdisciplinary approach to understanding crime patterns."

- **Measurement Issues:** The study discusses the arbitrary nature of areal unit boundaries and the potential inaccuracy of characteristic data in representing local perceptions.
- **Temporal Limitations:** The study is limited by its retrospective nature, which made it impossible to obtain certain data at the small area level.

  - ""The main reason for this was because they could not be directly attributed to a specific individual.""
  - ""Also, due to the underlying mechanisms of this model, the data had to be restricted to one city. It was also necessary to omit attacks in Belfast committed by non-residents and incidents outside of Belfast committed by Belfast residents from the sample, thus the effects of the distance variables may be underestimated.""",NA,"- **Sample Limitations:** The study acknowledges that the sample size is smaller compared to similar studies, which could lead to parameter inflation and skewed distributions. A larger sample size would have improved the model's power and reliability.
- **Causal Inference:** The study does not explicitly mention limitations in establishing causality, but the use of a discrete choice model implies that the relationships are based on observed patterns rather than direct causal links.
- **Generalizability:** The study is limited to Belfast and PIRA members, which restricts its generalizability to other contexts or terrorist groups. The authors suggest replicating the study in other cities and with different groups to increase generalizability.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study is restricted to one city and one terrorist group, making it difficult to compare findings across different contexts or time periods.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are specific to the context of Belfast and PIRA, which may not be applicable to other cities or terrorist groups.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on core PIRA members in Belfast, which is not a complete dataset of all PIRA activity in the city. This limits the population scope of the study.","- ""The findings support the proposition that terrorists make decisions that are guided by rationality and act in a similar way to urban criminals.""
  - ""The results demonstrate the characteristics of the target SAs as well as the properties of their likely journey to the target influenced the location of PIRA attacks.""
  - ""The findings are very promising and provide further support that terrorists behave similarly to 'traditional' criminals in terms of spatial decision making when selecting targets.""

- Significant predictors include the presence of legal businesses like pawn shops, grocery stores, and barber shops, as well as illegal businesses like drug dealing or prostitution. Accessibility measures such as being located along main streets and having an El station are also significant.

The first applies to spatial scale. While classic studies on the geography of crime (Shaw and McKay, 1942;Sampson et al., 1997) have used large urban areas as their spatial units of analysis, recent research suggests that often crime concentrations are not larger than a street segment (Smith et al., 2000;Weisburd et al., 2004) or street corner (McCord and Ratcliffe, 2007). To improve our understanding of the fine-grained spatial decisions of street robbers, we zoom in to the level of census blocks.""
  - ""We use data that are disaggregated to the level of census blocks. In Chicago, with an average surface of 140 m Ã 140 m (460 ftÃ 460 ft) and an average population of 118 residents, census blocks are approximately 30 times smaller than census tracts.""
  - ""When performing the analysis on units as small as census blocks, spatial spillover effects are plausible (Bernasco, 2010). For example, a retail store that attracts robbers will not only pull robbers to the block where it is located, but also to adjacent blocks that are just across the street and around the corner.""
  - ""The hypothesis is not self-evident, however, because the opposite phenomenon, spatial competition, is plausible as well. Spatial competition implies that the presence of robbery attractors in adjacent blocks pulls away robbers from the focal block and thus has a negative effect in the probability of robbery in the focal block.""
  - ""The existence of this 'spatial agglomeration effect' (Fotheringham, 1988) was expected because street robbers must attack close to the businesses that their potential victims are heading to or returning from, as otherwise the victims will have entered their homes, vehicles, public transport or other facilities.""

More generally, it did not contain information on prior crimes or past residential addresses of the offenders.""
  - ""Our discrete choice model assumes that robbers in Chicago know the attributes of all 24,594 census blocks. This is a strong assumption, as robbers will typically have detailed knowledge only of the area in the vicinity of their home and around specific activity nodes that are part of their daily routines, legal ones like school, work and leisure and possibly illegal ones like dealing of buying drugs.""
  - ""Our findings confirm that proximity to home is among the most important criteria for deciding on a robbery location. This finding could also reflect that robbers are not aware of potential robbery locations located farther away, locations that effectively are not part of their choice set.""
  - ""Our data did not contain appropriate localized measures of factors that could potentially deter robbers and force them to choose alternative robbery locations.""

  - ""The data collection technique is not without its drawbacks. The inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a bias sample, as these cannot be coded.""
  - ""Robustness checks were carried out using alternative neighbourhood boundaries to explore whether the reported results were a statistical artefact caused by a poorly defined neighbourhood unit.""
  - ""The results from this study indicate that the behaviour of burglars out on the street does, on the whole, concur with the claims by participants in experimental scenarios or interviews in previous research.""",NA,"- The paper discusses the concurrence of findings with previous research, which implies a focus on the consistency of results across different studies, but it does not explicitly address scale effects or spatial autocorrelation.
- The rejection of null hypotheses for certain property-level attributes suggests that these factors are significant at the scale of individual properties, but again, this does not directly address spatial scale effects.
- The limitation related to the inability to capture isolated properties due to Google Car's limitations suggests a scale limitation in terms of data collection, as it biases the sample towards more accessible properties.

  - ""It is worthwhile noting that this study cannot claim to have infallibly replicated the experience of a burglar selecting a suitable target.""
  - ""The measurements and statistical analyses employed cannot necessarily capture all of the nuances glimpsed from one-on-one interviews in previous research.""
  - ""The downside of this research design is that one cannot estimate predicted probabilities of burglary, given that the sample is not representative.""
  - ""The method of creating the four main constructs assumes that each item is equally important. To assess this assumption, sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to explore the extent to which the items were constructed and weighted suitably.""
  - ""The results suggested that some items are 'unhappy' being weighted equally to other items within the constructs.""
  - ""Robustness checks were carried out using alternative neighbourhood boundaries to explore whether the reported results were a statistical artefact caused by a poorly defined neighbourhood unit.""",NA,"- **Data Quality Issues:** The study acknowledges that the data collection technique using Google Street View has limitations, particularly in capturing isolated properties, which can lead to a biased sample (Quotes 2 and 3). This is a data quality issue as it affects the accuracy and completeness of the data.
- **Missing Data:** The inability to capture isolated properties due to Google Car limitations is a form of missing data, as these properties cannot be included in the analysis (Quotes 2 and 3).
