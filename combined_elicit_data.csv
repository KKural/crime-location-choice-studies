- **Causal Inference:** The study does not explicitly address limitations in establishing causality, but the reliance on recorded crime data and assumptions about offender behavior may introduce challenges in inferring causal relationships.
- **Generalizability:** The study is limited to the Belgian province of East Flanders, which may not be representative of other regions or countries. The focus on houses rather than apartments also limits generalizability to other types of dwellings.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not provide direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods, which could limit its applicability to other settings.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are specific to the study area in East Flanders, Belgium, and may not apply to other regions with different demographic and environmental characteristics.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on burglars in East Flanders, which may not be representative of all burglars or burglary patterns in other areas.","- ""This study sought to answer which house attributes influence burglars' decision when selecting a target.""

  - ""Second, like previous crime location choice studies this study did not explicitly acknowledge that offender's consideration with regard to crime site selection apply to multiple levels of spatial aggregation.""
  - ""Testing such models involves applying a variation of the nested logit model""
  - ""Finally, future applications could study burglars' cost and benefit balancing process in detail by investigating the presence of interaction effects between attributes of reward, effort and risk.""",NA,"- Theoretical Contributions: The study advances crime location choice theory by modeling the target selection process at the house level, which is a finer spatial resolution than previous studies (Quotes 1, 2).
- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that policy should focus on effort-related attributes, such as distance from the offender's home and ease of access (Quote 3).
- Crime Prevention Implications: The study implies that crime prevention strategies should target houses that are easily accessible and close to potential offenders' homes (Quote 3).
- Urban Planning Implications: The study suggests that urban planning should consider the layout and accessibility of residential areas to reduce burglary opportunities (Quote 3).
- Policy Recommendations: The study recommends focusing on effort-related attributes in policy and practice (Quote 3).
- Future Research Directions: The authors suggest further research on house-level data, exploring multiple levels of spatial aggregation, and investigating interaction effects between attributes (Quotes 6, 7, 8, 9).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study suggests using finer spatial units, such as the house level, for future research (Quote 2).
- Data Collection Suggestions: The authors recommend exploring additional house-level data sources, such as land registers or insurance companies (Quote 7).
- Methodological Improvements: The study suggests using variations of the nested logit model to account for multiple levels of spatial aggregation (Quote 9).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study has implications for understanding how burglars select targets, which can inform broader societal strategies for crime prevention (Quote 3).
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects to urban planning and policy by suggesting that these fields should consider the spatial layout and accessibility of residential areas (Quote 3)."

- **Model Limitations:** The study uses discrete choice models, which assume offenders choose locations based on expected utility, but it does not account for other decision-making processes (Quote 6).
- **Analytical Constraints:** The study cannot empirically distinguish between different explanations for the findings due to data limitations (Quote 5).","- ""Although the present study offers important insights into offenders' spatiotemporal criminal decision-making, some caveats and opportunities for future research should be mentioned. First, this study relies on police data regarding arrested offenders. As only a proportion of all crimes are solved by the police, the results from this study might suffer from detection bias.""
  - ""The question remains whether we can generalize our findings to nonarrested offenders because there might be differences in the probability of arrest between first offenders and offenders who committed multiple offenses in the same area.""
  - ""However, recent research suggests that detection bias is not as large as has often been assumed in previous literature (Johnson et al. 2009;Lammers 2014;Summers, Johnson, and Rengert 2010). These studies found little evidence that solved and unsolved offenses display large spatiotemporal differences.""
  - ""the fact that our offender population was arrested for offenses committed at a certain place and time might seem contradicting to our predictions based on rational choice and crime pattern theory.""
  - ""Another possible explanation for why offenders return to previously targeted areas even if they were arrested could be that those that got caught reduce their sanction certainty estimate based on a belief that they would have had to be exceedingly unlucky to get arrested.""
  - ""our hypotheses are built on the assumption that offenders actively learn about suitable targets at particular times and days and that they subsequently use this information in their future spatiotemporal criminal decisionmaking. However, we did not explicitly test such an underlying ""state dependence"" mechanism, and other explanations for our findings are also possible.""
  - ""Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to distinguish between these different types of explanations, and hence, we could not empirically assess the extent to which these other mechanisms might explain our findings.""
  - ""the main finding of our study emphasizes that the understudied role of time of day and part of week in crime location choice studies deserves more attention. Extending crime pattern theory by adding a cyclic time dimension to awareness spaces, the present study contributed to the geography of crime literature by stressing that offenders' knowledge about potential risks, rewards, and opportunities could no longer be conceptualized as completely time-invariant.""",NA,"- **Sample Limitations:** The study relies on police data regarding arrested offenders, which may suffer from detection bias since not all crimes are solved by the police. This could limit the representativeness of the sample.
- **Causal Inference:** The study does not explicitly test the underlying mechanism of how offenders learn about suitable targets, which could limit the ability to establish causality between the timing of offenses and crime location choices.
- **Generalizability:** The findings may not generalize to nonarrested offenders due to potential differences in the probability of arrest. However, recent research suggests that detection bias may not be as significant as previously thought.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not provide direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods, which could limit the ability to generalize findings to other settings.
- **Context Specificity:** The study's findings are based on data from the Netherlands, which may have specific cultural, legal, or environmental factors that could affect the generalizability of the results to other contexts.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on repeat offenders, which may not be representative of all offenders, particularly first-time offenders or those who do not commit multiple offenses in the same area.","- ""This study contributes to the geography of crime research in three ways. First, we extend Brantingham and Brantingham's (1981;2008) crime pattern theory by arguing that offender awareness spaces are not static over the week or day but rather time-specific.""
  - ""These results are not only important for how we should think about the time specificity of offenders' awareness spaces and how this provides a better explanation of their crime location choices.""
  - ""Our findings show that the likelihood to return to previously targeted areas is actually increased at similar days of the week and similar times of the day, whereas most predictive policing applications do not take such cyclic time effects into account but merely rely on spatial and temporal decay functions.""
  - ""our findings imply that also time-specific situational preventive measures that make a targeted area less attractive on similar days and times of previous crimes could help preventing future crime in that area (e.g., improve lighting in an area that was targeted at night).""
  - ""Although the present study offers important insights into offenders' spatiotemporal criminal decision-making, some caveats and opportunities for future research should be mentioned.""
  - ""future studies could measure which other activity nodes than the ones currently available for research are visited by offenders and when they are usually visited.""
  - ""Future research might also take more direct measures of time-varying target attractiveness into account, for example, by focusing on effects of opening and closing hours of facilities and businesses on crime location choices.""
  - ""To examine time-varying target attractiveness that relate more specifically to certain crime types such as bike theft, car theft, or robbery, future research might also consider carrying out systematic observations to determine variations in, for example, the number of bicycles, motor vehicles, or people in a given area.""",NA,"- The study advances crime location choice theory by introducing the concept of time-specific awareness spaces, which are dynamic and not static over the week or day (Theoretical Contributions).

It also supports crime pattern theory by highlighting the role of awareness spaces in target choices (Quote 7).
- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that communities with high crime rates may be due to high offending rates among nonlocal migrants rather than preference for targeting those areas (Quote 2). This has implications for policy targeting these communities.
- Crime Prevention Implications: Understanding that physical and social barriers affect crime location choices can inform crime prevention strategies by focusing on areas with fewer barriers (Quote 6).
- Urban Planning Implications: The study's findings on physical barriers like rivers and roads can inform urban planning to reduce crime by designing spaces that limit criminal mobility (Quote 6).
- Policy Recommendations: The study does not explicitly provide policy recommendations, but the implications suggest focusing on areas with high offending rates and designing urban spaces to limit criminal mobility.
- Future Research Directions: Future studies should explore whether the findings generalize to non-arrested burglars (Quote 8) and address limitations such as temporal mismatches in data (Quote 4) and lack of direct wealth measures (Quote 5).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study does not explicitly mention optimal spatial units or scales, but it suggests considering the impact of physical and social barriers at various scales.
- Data Collection Suggestions: Future studies should aim to include more direct measures of wealth and address temporal mismatches in data collection (Quotes 4 and 5).
- Methodological Improvements: The study suggests improving analytical approaches by including non-arrested burglars and addressing data limitations (Quotes 3 and 8).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study highlights the importance of understanding crime patterns in relation to urban design and social segregation, which has broader implications for societal safety and justice.
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects crime location choice theory with urban planning and sociology, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understand crime patterns."

- Crime Prevention Implications: The study suggests that securing and monitoring areas frequently visited by potential offenders could reduce crime risk (Quote 5).
- Urban Planning Implications: The findings are relevant for urban planning as they suggest replacing frequently visited activity nodes and securing broader areas to reduce crime (Quote 5).
- Policy Recommendations: The study recommends systematically recording information on areas visited by known offenders and strategically securing these areas (Quotes 4, 5).
- Future Research Directions: The authors suggest conducting research with larger and more diverse offender samples to test the generalizability of findings (Quote 7).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study suggests using more detailed spatial units to capture awareness spaces and travel paths (Quote 9).
- Data Collection Suggestions: The authors recommend using continuous GPS-tracking to gather detailed data on activity nodes and travel routes (Quote 10).
- Methodological Improvements: Future studies should aim to increase the quality and integrality of data on awareness spaces and offense locations (Quote 8).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study's findings have broader implications for criminal justice by providing insights into offender behavior that can inform policy and prevention strategies (Quotes 4, 5).

- **Geographic Limitations:** The study was conducted in New Zealand, but there is no mention of specific geographic limitations within the country.
- **Model Limitations:** The study used discrete choice models, which require a dataset with specific characteristics (Quote 11). Sampling was used to manage computational barriers (Quote 12).
- **Analytical Constraints:** The study had to rely on proxies for reliability and relevance due to data limitations (Quote 2), and there were constraints in interpreting specific effect sizes due to error sources (Quote 5).","- ""The present study overcame both these limitations. Importantly, the consistency of the observed pattern for reliability and relevance across crime types indicates that it likely generalizes beyond the crimes included in this study.""
  - ""That said, we recommend future studies expand the range of crimes included, to test this suggestion empirically, using both police data and other sources (discussed further below).""
  - ""From a methodological perspective, it would be informative to explore whether the results generalize to crime types where the spatial distribution-in police data-is heavily influenced by variations in reporting or proactive policing (e.g., disorder and drug offenses).""
  - ""The use of a dataset from a hitherto understudied part of the world also adds support to the generalizability of crime pattern theory, and its recent extension, across crime behaviors and contexts.""
  - ""Another avenue for future research in continuing the empirical investigation of Curtis-Ham et al.'s (2020) model, would be to consider different subgroups of offenders.""
  - ""our results should be interpreted in light of several limitations which illustrate the challenges involved in operationalizing these attributes using police administrative data, within the DSCM paradigm.""
  - ""First, our measures of reliability and relevance-constructed by combining attributes of offenders' activity locations-were proxies for offenders' knowledge; we did not assess their knowledge directly.""
  - ""Second, our method for filling in missing data in the reliability and relevance variables necessarily introduced some imprecision.""
  - ""Considering these sources of error, in drawing conclusions we put more emphasis on the general pattern, seen consistently across the crime types, than the specific effect sizes observed.""",NA,"- **Sample Limitations:** The study uses a large dataset from New Zealand, which is a strength, but the authors suggest that future studies should expand the range of crimes included to further test generalizability. This indicates a limitation in the scope of crimes studied.
- **Causal Inference:** The study uses proxies for offenders' knowledge, which may not directly assess their internal decision-making processes. This could limit the ability to establish causality between activity locations and crime choices.
- **Generalizability:** The study suggests that the findings may generalize beyond the crimes included, but recommends further research to confirm this. The use of a dataset from a previously understudied region supports generalizability across contexts.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not compare across different contexts or time periods explicitly, but suggests that future research should explore these aspects, particularly for crimes influenced by reporting or policing variations.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are based on data from New Zealand, which may have unique characteristics compared to other regions. The study's generalizability to other contexts is supported but requires further testing.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on offenders with identified activity locations, which may not represent all offenders. The authors suggest considering different subgroups of offenders in future research.","- ""The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.""
  - ""Our findings broaden the empirical evidence base for crime pattern theory (Brantingham & Brantingham, 1991, 1993a) and its extension in the model proposed by Curtis-Ham et al. (2020) in several ways.""
  - ""the findings demonstrate the salience of a broad range of activity locations to offenders' crime location choices.""
  - ""understanding the combined contribution of reliability and relevance is important for informing predictions about where individual offenders are likely to offend, which in turn can inform crime prevention and investigation strategies.""
  - ""Practitioners conducting geographic profiling (Rossmo, 2000) in police investigations could apply these factors to assess suspects' likelihood of having committed a crime given the location and attributes their nearby activity locations, and prioritize the suspects accordingly""
  - ""Practitioners working with offenders in the community could apply these factors to identify offenders' highest risk locations for re-offending and devise plans to manage the risk such locations present.""
  - ""The theoretical framework tested in this paper, particularly the concepts of reliability and relevance, could be used when analyzing aggregate crime patterns.""
  - ""Understanding how opportunity and collective familiarity and activity similarity are interacting to produce crime could help inform more nuanced interventions.""
  - ""Our findings add to the empirical evidence base for crime pattern theory and its recent extension by Curtis-Ham et al. (2020).""
  - ""By advancing our understanding of the kinds of places that people are more likely to commit crime, this research enhances our ability to predict where people will offend-individually and collectively, with important implications for crime prevention and investigation.""
  - ""Further research could supplement the present findings using complementary methods that overcome the above limitations.""
  - ""in-depth interviews could be used to investigate offenders' perceived familiarity with locations and similarity of prior activities to a given crime, and the relative roles of these constructs in the decision where to commit that crime.""
  - ""Time-use surveys could overcome the inherent lack of completeness and detail in police records by capturing the timing, location, and behavior involved in offenders' pre-offense activities with greater precision and detail.""
  - ""Survey methods could also extend on recent survey based DSCM studies by explicitly including the reliability and relevance variables, though sample sizes would need to be increased considerably""
  - ""Our interpretation of the observed patterns for reliability and relevance could also be corroborated by future research including a wider range of opportunity variables to better isolate the effects of opportunities versus activities, examining other crime types, and seeing if the threshold effect appears in other jurisdictions.""",NA,"- Theoretical Contributions: The study advances crime location choice theory by supporting the extension of crime pattern theory, emphasizing the importance of reliability and relevance in predicting crime locations (Quotes 1, 2, 9).
- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that understanding reliability and relevance can inform crime prevention and investigation strategies, particularly in geographic profiling and managing re-offending risks (Quotes 4, 5, 6).
- Crime Prevention Implications: The study suggests that identifying high-risk locations based on reliability and relevance can help in devising plans to manage re-offending risks (Quote 6).
- Urban Planning Implications: The study does not directly address urban planning implications, but understanding how opportunity and familiarity interact could inform more nuanced interventions (Quote 8).
- Policy Recommendations: Practitioners should apply reliability and relevance factors in geographic profiling and managing re-offending risks (Quotes 5, 6).

- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study does not explicitly mention optimal spatial units or scales for future work.
- Data Collection Suggestions: Future research should consider using time-use surveys and in-depth interviews for more detailed data (Quotes 12, 13).
- Methodological Improvements: The study suggests using complementary methods to improve data completeness and detail (Quotes 11, 12, 13).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study enhances the ability to predict crime locations, which has implications for crime prevention and investigation (Quote 10).
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects to fields like environmental criminology and investigative psychology (Quote 10)."

  - ""In the spatial choice model, the spatial unit of analysis applies to the definition of what it is that offenders choose when they decide where to offend.

  - ""Furthermore, our reading of the empirical literature that addresses the modifiable area unit problem in the context of crime (e.g., Hipp, 2007; Wooldredge, 2002) is that effects tend to be fairly robust across geographic levels of aggregation.""",NA,"- The paper uses census tracts as the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) for their study, which is a common choice in spatial crime research.
- The authors justify this choice by mentioning that it was the smallest unit for which collective efficacy data was available and that using smaller units would have required a significant reduction in sample size.
- They acknowledge that smaller units of analysis can reduce within-unit heterogeneity, but they also note that effects tend to be robust across different geographic levels of aggregation, suggesting a degree of scale insensitivity.
- The paper does not explicitly discuss spatial autocorrelation or perform tests for it.
- The authors recommend using smaller units of spatial aggregation in future work to capture more detailed spatial patterns and reduce within-tract heterogeneity.
- The limitation of using census tracts is noted, as it may not fully capture the spatial dynamics for offenders who commit crimes within their home tract.","- ""Unfortunately, the current study uses police records and, thus, excludes unreported robberies; therefore, it may underestimate the attraction value of illegal markets for robbers.""
  - ""The collective efficacy measure was created by Sampson and his colleagues (Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997) and was provided to us for use in this research. The measure is based on a population survey among a neighborhood cluster sample, in which Chicago residents answered questions on the perceived extent of social cohesion and social control in their local communities (for details of the instrument, see Earls et al., 1997). Note that this survey-based measure was aggregated to the census tract level, and therefore, it has a greater error of measurement than other measures in the analysis (Raudenbush and Sampson, 1999).""
  - ""The data do not allow us to identify with certainty the same robbers across multiple incidents. Thus, we cannot ascertain whether the same person is arrested for multiple robberies.""
  - ""The estimation of discrete choice models requires a considerable amount of computer resources when both the number of observations (choices) and the number of alternatives per choice are large.""
  - ""We have also neglected temporal variation. Great places for robbery in the morning may be pretty useless places at night. An entertainment district may be an excellent place to rob in the weekend, but less so on other days. Temporal variations and temporal constraints are generally neglected in criminological research (Ratcliffe, 2006), and our inquiry is no exception.""

- **Generalizability:** The study extends the external validity by examining a previously unstudied crime type and geographic location, suggesting some generalizability. However, the exclusion of crimes from outside the study area and the focus on a specific type of crime (TFV) might limit generalizability to other contexts.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not provide direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods, which could limit its ability to inform about variations in offender spatial decision making across different settings.
- **Context Specificity:** The findings are specific to the context of TFV in Dorset, UK, and may not apply to other types of crimes or locations. The study's focus on a specific geographic area and crime type could make it difficult to generalize findings to other contexts.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on detected incidents of TFV, which might not represent all TFV incidents or offenders. The population constraints are related to the availability of data and the focus on a specific crime type.","- ""The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.""
  - ""The influence of the road network on adult offender spatial decision making is a particularly novel result and this finding, along with those concerned with the impact of routine activity nodes on offender spatial decision making, has potential policy implications for those involved in the development of urban spaces.""
  - ""Conducting a formal crime impact assessment (for a further discussion, see Bowers, 2014; Ekblom, 1997Ekblom, , 2002) ) that is informed by findings such as those presented here would be one way of doing this.""

  - ""using a discrete choice approach, the present study provides further evidence to support crime pattern and social disorganization theory in explaining offender spatial decision making.""
  - ""The present study demonstrates that this is true for a type of crime not studied previously, and for a geographical location not studied elsewhere, thereby extending the external validity of the research base and demonstrating the generality of these theories at explaining the distribution of different types of crime.""
  - ""In addition, we extend criminological understanding by showing that, in line with the expectations articulated in the introduction, the connectivity of an area, and the distribution of routine activity nodes, appear to have a direct effect on offender spatial decision making, and that these effects differ for younger and older offenders.""
  - ""future research that does this would make a valuable contribution to the literature.""
  - ""Future research using the discrete choice approach might systematically examine the role of routine activity nodes other than the home location, although this will require the analysis or collection of data other than that recorded by the police.""
  - ""The use of the latter will undoubtedly be necessary if hypotheses such as those articulated above are to be tested in the future.""
  - ""Considering the mechanisms through which social cohesion might influence the likelihood of crime occurrence, it may do so either through residents influencing the behavior of others in their neighborhood, or by deterring offenders from targeting a particular neighborhood.""
  - ""Recent studies have begun to explore these issues (e.g., Reynald, 2011;Weisburd et al., 2012), but more research is needed.""
  - ""In addition to examining variation across places, research might also examine if and how the potential for collective action might vary over time.""",NA,"- Theoretical Contributions: The study advances crime location choice theory by providing evidence for crime pattern and social disorganization theories, particularly in how connectivity and routine activity nodes influence offender decision-making (Quotes 6, 7, 8).
- Policy Implications: The findings suggest that urban planners should consider crime risk when designing urban spaces and road networks (Quotes 2, 3, 4).
- Crime Prevention Implications: The study implies that understanding offender spatial decision-making can inform crime prevention strategies, particularly by considering the impact of urban design on crime risk (Quotes 2, 5).
- Urban Planning Implications: Urban planners should consider the potential crime risk implications of their designs, especially regarding connectivity and the placement of new facilities (Quotes 3, 5).
- Policy Recommendations: Conducting formal crime impact assessments is recommended to inform urban planning decisions (Quote 4).
- Future Research Directions: Future research should explore the role of other routine activity nodes and how collective action varies over time (Quotes 9, 10, 14).
- Spatial Scale Recommendations: The study suggests using smaller spatial units like Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) for analysis (implied by the use of LSOAs in the study).
- Data Collection Suggestions: Future research should collect data on routine activity nodes beyond home locations (Quote 10).
- Methodological Improvements: The study suggests using the discrete choice approach to examine offender decision-making (Quotes 6, 10).
- Broader Societal Implications: The study contributes to understanding how urban design affects crime risk, which has broader implications for community safety and crime prevention (Quotes 2, 3, 5).
- Interdisciplinary Connections: The study connects criminology with urban planning and design, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to crime prevention (Quotes 2, 3, 4)."

- **Context Specificity:** The findings are specific to the context of Belfast and PIRA, which may not be applicable to other cities or terrorist groups.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on core PIRA members in Belfast, which is not a complete dataset of all PIRA activity in the city.

The first applies to spatial scale. While classic studies on the geography of crime (Shaw and McKay, 1942;Sampson et al., 1997) have used large urban areas as their spatial units of analysis, recent research suggests that often crime concentrations are not larger than a street segment (Smith et al., 2000;Weisburd et al., 2004) or street corner (McCord and Ratcliffe, 2007). To improve our understanding of the fine-grained spatial decisions of street robbers, we zoom in to the level of census blocks.""
  - ""We use data that are disaggregated to the level of census blocks. In Chicago, with an average surface of 140 m Â 140 m (460 ftÂ 460 ft) and an average population of 118 residents, census blocks are approximately 30 times smaller than census tracts.""
  - ""When performing the analysis on units as small as census blocks, spatial spillover effects are plausible (Bernasco, 2010). For example, a retail store that attracts robbers will not only pull robbers to the block where it is located, but also to adjacent blocks that are just across the street and around the corner.""
  - ""The hypothesis is not self-evident, however, because the opposite phenomenon, spatial competition, is plausible as well. Spatial competition implies that the presence of robbery attractors in adjacent blocks pulls away robbers from the focal block and thus has a negative effect in the probability of robbery in the focal block.""
  - ""The existence of this 'spatial agglomeration effect' (Fotheringham, 1988) was expected because street robbers must attack close to the businesses that their potential victims are heading to or returning from, as otherwise the victims will have entered their homes, vehicles, public transport or other facilities.""
  - ""the universal logit model was extended with the 15 same attributes of second-order spatially adjacent blocks (because of computer memory limitations we used a sample of 4000 instead of 6000 alternatives for this analysis). With one single exception, the estimates (presented in Supplementary Table S4 of the Supplementary Appendix) were nonsignificant.""
  - ""the estimates of the spatially lagged adjacent block variables indicate that robbery attraction spills over to adjacent blocks. The effects of the 'spatially lagged' variables, listed in the bottom part of Table 4 under the 'Adjacent blocks' heading, are positive like those of the regular variables, indicating that the same factors that make robbers select a particular block also make them select adjacent blocks.""",NA,"- The paper discusses the use of census blocks as the spatial unit of analysis, which is a finer scale compared to larger urban areas or census tracts. This indicates a focus on scale effects by choosing a smaller spatial unit.
- The authors mention that using census blocks allows for the analysis of spatial spillover effects, which is a scale-related finding. This suggests that the choice of spatial scale affects the ability to detect these effects.

More generally, it did not contain information on prior crimes or past residential addresses of the offenders.""
  - ""Our discrete choice model assumes that robbers in Chicago know the attributes of all 24,594 census blocks. This is a strong assumption, as robbers will typically have detailed knowledge only of the area in the vicinity of their home and around specific activity nodes that are part of their daily routines, legal ones like school, work and leisure and possibly illegal ones like dealing of buying drugs.""
  - ""Our findings confirm that proximity to home is among the most important criteria for deciding on a robbery location. This finding could also reflect that robbers are not aware of potential robbery locations located farther away, locations that effectively are not part of their choice set.""
  - ""Our data did not contain appropriate localized measures of factors that could potentially deter robbers and force them to choose alternative robbery locations.""
  - ""Although it is important that future work includes such measures, their inclusion in empirical models may not be straightforward. Many of the factors that might deter robbers could actually be reactions of law enforcement, potential victims and other offenders to elevated robbery rates.""

  - ""The multinomial logit model is characterized by the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIAs) property, which is the assumption that the unobserved utility components are uncorrelated across alternatives.""

  - ""The results from this study indicate that the behaviour of burglars out on the street does, on the whole, concur with the claims by participants in experimental scenarios or interviews in previous research.""",NA,"- The paper discusses the concurrence of findings with previous research, which implies a focus on the consistency of results across different studies, but it does not explicitly address scale effects or spatial autocorrelation.
- The rejection of null hypotheses for certain property-level attributes suggests that these factors are significant at the scale of individual properties, but again, this does not directly address spatial scale effects.
- The limitation related to the inability to capture isolated properties due to Google Car's limitations suggests a scale limitation in terms of data collection, as it biases the sample towards more accessible properties.
- The robustness checks using alternative neighbourhood boundaries indicate an attempt to assess the sensitivity of results to different spatial scales, but the paper does not provide detailed findings on this aspect.
- There is no explicit discussion of spatial autocorrelation or recommendations for optimal spatial scales in the provided text.","- ""The principle disadvantage of this research is that it remains unclear whether the actual behaviour by burglars outside of the interview room concurs with these findings.""
  - ""The data collection technique is not without its drawbacks. The inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a bias sample, as these cannot be coded.""

  - ""Robustness checks were carried out using alternative neighbourhood boundaries to explore whether the reported results were a statistical artefact caused by a poorly defined neighbourhood unit.""",NA,"- **Data Quality Issues:** The study acknowledges that the data collection technique using Google Street View has limitations, particularly in capturing isolated properties, which can lead to a biased sample (Quotes 2 and 3). This is a data quality issue as it affects the accuracy and completeness of the data.
- **Missing Data:** The inability to capture isolated properties due to Google Car limitations is a form of missing data, as these properties cannot be included in the analysis (Quotes 2 and 3).
- **Data Source Limitations:** The use of Google Street View as a data source has limitations, such as not being able to capture isolated properties (Quotes 2 and 3).
- **Measurement Issues:** The study notes that the measurements and statistical analyses may not capture all nuances from one-on-one interviews (Quote 6), and there are issues with assuming equal importance of items within constructs (Quotes 8 and 9).
- **Temporal Limitations:** The study suggests that behavior may vary depending on the time of day, which is not explored in this research (Quote 4).
- **Geographic Limitations:** The study is limited to The Hague, Netherlands, which may not be representative of other geographic areas (implied by the focus on this specific location).
- **Model Limitations:** The research design does not allow for the estimation of predicted probabilities of burglary due to a non-representative sample (Quote 7).

  - ""It is worthwhile noting that this study cannot claim to have infallibly replicated the experience of a burglar selecting a suitable target.""",NA,"- **Sample Limitations:** The study acknowledges that the sample is not representative, which affects the ability to estimate predicted probabilities of burglary. The sample size is also described as ""rather low,"" which could impact the reliability of findings.
- **Causal Inference:** The study does not explicitly mention limitations in establishing causality, but the inability to estimate predicted probabilities and the non-representative sample could imply challenges in inferring causal relationships.
- **Generalizability:** The study's findings may not be generalizable due to the non-representative sample and the specific context of using Google Street View data, which may not capture all nuances of real-world burglary target selection.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not provide direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods, which limits its ability to generalize findings beyond the specific study context.
- **Context Specificity:** The study is conducted in The Hague, Netherlands, using specific data collection methods, which may make the findings context-specific and not easily applicable to other locations or contexts.
- **Population Constraints:** The study focuses on single-family homes, which may not be representative of all types of residential properties, limiting the applicability of findings to other types of dwellings.","- ""Burglary target selection does not stop at the selection of a target neighbourhood, but certain characteristics of individual properties within the same neighbourhood are in turn indicative of burglary risk.""
  - ""Quantitative analyses partly support findings from the offender-based research on residential burglary.""
  - ""We encourage future research to consider using GSV as a method of collecting fresh data, with the broader aim of explaining criminal behaviour at micro-spatial scales.""
  - ""Though collecting small-scale bespoke data runs against the grain, this study has shown that by collecting such tailored information, one can shed a different light on a phenomenon than by using readily available, generic data.""
