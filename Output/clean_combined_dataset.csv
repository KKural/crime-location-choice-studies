- Significant Predictors: Surveillability, accessibility, ease of escape.
- Effect Directions: Increased surveillability decreases burglary likelihood; increased accessibility and ease of escape increase burglary likelihood.
- Effect Magnitudes: Surveillability (OR = 0.48), ease of escape (OR = 1.61), accessibility (OR = 1.46).

- Spatial Autocorrelation: Not mentioned.
- Scale Recommendations: Not mentioned.
- Scale Limitations: The inability to capture isolated properties due to Google Car limitations biases the sample.
- Cross-Scale Comparisons: Not mentioned.","- **Data Quality Issues:** The study acknowledges limitations in capturing isolated properties due to Google Street View's inability to access these areas, leading to a biased sample.
- **Missing Data:** Isolated properties cannot be coded due to Google Car limitations.
- **Data Source Limitations:** Google Street View cannot capture isolated properties.
- **Measurement Issues:** Measurements may not capture all nuances from one-on-one interviews; equal importance assumption for items within constructs may not hold.
- **Temporal Limitations:** Behavior may vary depending on the time of day, not explored in this study.
- **Geographic Limitations:** Study is limited to The Hague, Netherlands.
- **Model Limitations:** Research design does not allow for estimation of predicted probabilities of burglary due to a non-representative sample.
- **Analytical Constraints:** Measurements and statistical analyses may not fully replicate the experience of burglars selecting targets.","- **Sample Limitations:** Non-representative sample; low sample size.
- **Causal Inference:** Challenges in establishing causality due to non-representative sample and inability to estimate predicted probabilities.
- **Generalizability:** Limited generalizability due to non-representative sample and context-specific data collection methods.
- **Comparative Limitations:** No direct comparisons across different contexts or time periods.
- **Context Specificity:** Findings may be specific to The Hague, Netherlands, and single-family homes.
- **Population Constraints:** Focus on single-family homes limits applicability to other types of dwellings.","- **Theoretical Contributions:** The study advances crime location choice theory by highlighting the importance of property-level characteristics in burglary target selection.
- **Policy Implications:** Findings suggest focusing on property-level interventions to enhance surveillability and accessibility.
- **Crime Prevention Implications:** Enhance surveillability and reduce accessibility at the property level.
- **Urban Planning Implications:** Design neighborhoods with increased surveillability and reduced accessibility.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Use Google Street View for data collection and focus on property-level interventions.
- **Future Research Directions:** Explore other crime types and use GSV to mimic journey-to-crime routes.
- **Spatial Scale Recommendations:** Focus on micro-spatial scales.
- **Data Collection Suggestions:** Use GSV and address the limitation of capturing isolated properties.
- **Methodological Improvements:** Refine data collection techniques to reduce bias.
- **Broader Societal Implications:** Challenges big data approaches with tailored, small-scale data collection.
