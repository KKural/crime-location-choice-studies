- **Sample Size Effects:** Not mentioned (no specific effects of sample size on model performance discussed)
- **Convergence Issues:** Not mentioned (no estimation or convergence problems mentioned)","- **Main Results:** Robbers tend to choose areas close to their homes, with similar racial and ethnic compositions, and areas with high concentrations of potential victims and crime generators like drug markets and prostitution.
- **Significant Predictors:** Distance from home, racial and ethnic dissimilarity, gang territorial dissimilarity, presence of drug markets, prostitution markets, high schools, retail activities, and collective efficacy.
- **Effect Directions:** Distance from home decreases choice probability; similarity in racial and ethnic composition, presence of drug markets, prostitution markets, high schools, and retail activities increase choice probability; collective efficacy decreases choice probability.
- **Effect Magnitudes:** Odds increase by 17% for every additional 1,000 residents; racial and ethnic dissimilarity decreases choice probability by 58%; gang territorial dissimilarity by 50%; odds of choosing a tract of residence are 822 times higher than a distant tract.
- **Surprising Findings:** Collective efficacy effect was small and not statistically significant at the 1% level.
- **Robustness Checks:** Cross-validation was used to ensure robustness.","1. Presence of illegal markets | Attracts robbers due to potential for illegal transactions | Qualitative | Ethnographic studies

Smaller units could reduce within-unit heterogeneity.
- **Scale Sensitivity:** Effects tend to be robust across different geographic levels of aggregation, suggesting some scale insensitivity.
- **Spatial Autocorrelation:** Not explicitly discussed or tested.
- **Scale Recommendations:** Future work should consider using smaller units like block groups or blocks to capture more detailed spatial patterns.
- **Scale Limitations:** Using census tracts may not fully capture spatial dynamics for offenders committing crimes within their home tract.
- **Cross-Scale Comparisons:** Not explicitly discussed.","- **Data Quality Issues:** Exclusion of unreported robberies may underestimate the attraction value of illegal markets.
- **Missing Data:** Unable to identify repeat offenders across multiple incidents.
- **Data Source Limitations:** Collective efficacy measure has greater error due to aggregation from survey data.
- **Measurement Issues:** Collective efficacy measure's aggregation may introduce measurement errors.
- **Temporal Limitations:** Neglects temporal variation in robbery patterns.
- **Geographic Limitations:** Census tracts may not capture within-tract heterogeneity.
- **Model Limitations:** Discrete choice model requires significant computational resources.
- **Analytical Constraints:** Does not account for temporal variations in robbery patterns.","- **Sample Limitations:** Issues with identifying repeat offenders and exclusions based on ethnicity and age.
- **Causal Inference:** Use of cross-validation to ensure robustness, but no explicit limitations mentioned.
- **Generalizability:** Limited to Chicago; use of census tracts may affect generalizability.
- **Comparative Limitations:** No direct comparisons across contexts or time periods.
- **Context Specificity:** Findings specific to Chicago's demographic and spatial context.
- **Population Constraints:** Focus on cleared robbery cases in Chicago; may not represent all robberies or offenders.","- **Theoretical Contributions:** The study advances crime location choice theory by demonstrating how robbers choose target areas based on distance, social barriers, and crime generators.
- **Policy Implications:** The findings suggest addressing social barriers and crime generators in crime prevention strategies.
- **Crime Prevention Implications:** Focus on areas with high collective efficacy and reduce attractiveness of areas with crime generators.
- **Urban Planning Implications:** Urban design should consider spatial distribution of crime generators and social barriers.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Use smaller units of spatial aggregation and incorporate temporal alternatives into spatial choice models.
- **Future Research Directions:** Test other offender-based hypotheses and explore smaller spatial units.
- **Spatial Scale Recommendations:** Use smaller units of spatial aggregation.
- **Data Collection Suggestions:** Incorporate temporal data to improve understanding of spatial target selection.
- **Methodological Improvements:** Integrate journey to crime research with geographic distribution of criminal opportunities.
- **Broader Societal Implications:** Provides insights into how crime location choices are influenced by social and environmental factors.
- **Interdisciplinary Connections:** Integrates criminology with urban planning and sociology."
