# Appendix A: Detailed Search Strategy

This appendix provides the complete search strategy used for the systematic scoping review, including database-specific search strings, filters, and retrieval protocols.

## Search Strategy Development

### Conceptual Framework
The search strategy was developed using a three-concept approach:
1. **Crime/Criminal Behavior** 
2. **Location/Spatial Choice**
3. **Quantitative Methods**

### Key Search Terms by Concept

#### Concept 1: Crime and Criminal Behavior
- Primary terms: crime*, criminal*, offend*, burglar*, robber*, theft, steal*, vandal*, graffiti
- Secondary terms: delinquen*, antisocial, devian*, assault*, fraud*, drug dealing

#### Concept 2: Location and Spatial Choice
- Primary terms: location choice*, spatial choice*, site selection*, target selection*, place choice*
- Secondary terms: spatial decision*, geographic choice*, area selection*, venue choice*, destination choice*

#### Concept 3: Quantitative Spatial Methods
- Primary terms: discrete choice*, conditional logit*, mixed logit*, multinomial logit*
- Secondary terms: spatial model*, choice model*, logistic regression*, spatial analysis

## Supplementary Search Strategies

### Reference List Screening
- Manual screening of reference lists from all included studies
- Citation tracking using Web of Science and Google Scholar
- Identified 23 additional potentially relevant studies

### Journal Hand-Searching
Targeted hand-searching of key journals in criminology and spatial analysis:
- Journal of Quantitative Criminology (2000-2024)
- Crime & Delinquency (2000-2024)  
- Applied Geography (2010-2024)
- Journal of Economic Geography (2010-2024)
- Criminology (2000-2024)

### Expert Consultation
- Consultation with 3 leading researchers in spatial criminology
- Request for unpublished or in-press studies
- Identified 2 additional relevant studies

## Quality Control Measures

### Inter-rater Reliability
- Two reviewers independently screened 20% random sample
- Cohen's kappa for title/abstract screening: κ = 0.87
- Cohen's kappa for full-text screening: κ = 0.89
- Disagreements resolved through discussion

### Search Strategy Validation
- Verified that all known relevant studies were captured
- Tested alternative search terms and synonyms
- Consulted with information specialist librarian

### Documentation Protocol
- All search strategies documented with screenshots
- Search results exported with full bibliographic information
- Version control maintained for all search iterations

---

## Search Limitations

### Database Coverage
- Focus on English-language databases may have missed relevant non-English studies
- Disciplinary bias toward criminology and geography journals
- Limited coverage of computer science and transportation research venues

### Terminology Evolution
- Spatial choice modeling terminology has evolved over 20-year timeframe
- Early studies may have used different methodological terminology
- Some relevant studies may have been missed due to terminology differences

### Grey Literature
- Limited inclusion of conference proceedings, dissertations, working papers
- May have missed innovative methodological developments not yet published
- Potential publication bias toward significant findings

### Temporal Bias
- Emphasis on recent studies due to database indexing practices
- Early foundational studies may be under-represented
- Changing publication patterns in digital era

## Update Strategy

For future updates of this systematic review:

1. **Annual monitoring** of key journals and databases
2. **Alert systems** for new publications using validated search terms
3. **Expert network** maintenance for emerging study identification
4. **Citation tracking** of included studies for forward citation analysis
