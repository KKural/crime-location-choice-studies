1,y,FAMILY MATTERS: EFFECTS OF FAMILY MEMBERS' RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON CRIME LOCATION CHOICE,"According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2016,54,3,413,433,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12109,,22/02/2024
2,y,Target Selection Models with Preference Variation Between Offenders,"This study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders. Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age. Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders. This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2016,32,2,283,304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-015-9264-7,,22/02/2024
3,y,CO-OFFENDERS' CRIME LOCATION CHOICE: DO CO-OFFENDING GROUPS COMMIT CRIMES IN THEIR SHARED AWARENESS SPACE?,"This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: the extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2018,58,5,1193,1211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azx069,,22/02/2024
4,y,The Importance of Importance Sampling: Exploring Methods of Sampling from Alternatives in Discrete Choice Models of Crime Location Choice,"Objectives The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders' choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders' pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members' homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders' activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders' prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders' spatial decision making.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2022,38,4,1003,1031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-021-09526-5,Jul-21,22/02/2024
5,y,A Time for a Crime: Temporal Aspects of Repeat Offenders' Crime Location Choices,"Objectives: This article examines to what extent repeat offenders' crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times. Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models. Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime. Conclusions: Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2018,55,4,538,568,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427818766395,,22/02/2024
6,y,Location Choice of Snatching Offenders in Chennai City,"Objectives We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urban context by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations and presence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closer to their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offending locations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors and generators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime location choice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discuss limitations and make suggestions for future investigations.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2022,38,3,673,696,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-021-09514-9,May-21,22/02/2024
7,y,Relationships Between Offenders' Crime Locations and Different Prior Activity Locations as Recorded in Police Data,"Understanding the relationships between individual offenders' crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders' homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.",0882-0783,1936-6469,2023,38,1,172,185,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11896-022-09540-8,Aug-22,22/02/2024
8,y,"BITING ONCE, TWICE: THE INFLUENCE OF PRIOR ON SUBSEQUENT CRIME LOCATION CHOICE","Properties, victims, and locations previously targeted by offenders have an increased risk of being targeted again within a short time period. It has been suggested that often the same offenders are involved in these repeated events and, thus, that offenders' prior crime location choices influence their subsequent crime location choices. This article examines repeated crime location choices, testing the hypothesis that offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area they previously targeted than in areas they did not target before. Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses. The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices. The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2015,53,3,309,329,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12071,,22/02/2024
9,y,Modeling Micro-Level Crime Location Choice: Application of the Discrete Choice Framework to Crime at Places,"Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2010,26,1,113,138,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-009-9086-6,,22/02/2024
10,y,"Right place, right time? Making crime pattern theory time-specific","Objectives Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender's spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted.",,2193-7680,2021,10,1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40163-021-00139-8,,22/02/2024
11,y,The usefulness of past crime data as an attractiveness index for residential burglars,"This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.",1544-4759,1544-4767,2018,15,3,257,270,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jip.1507,,22/02/2024
12,y,Testing Ecological Theories of Offender Spatial Decision Making Using a Discrete Choice Model,"Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives-crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.",0011-1287,1552-387X,2015,61,3,454,480,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0011128714540276,,22/02/2024
13,y,AWARENESS x OPPORTUNITY: TESTING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ACTIVITY NODES AND CRIMINAL OPPORTUNITY IN PREDICTING CRIME LOCATION CHOICE,"According to crime pattern theory, offenders likely commit crimes in areas where their awareness space overlaps with criminal opportunity. If both are necessary conditions for crime to take place somewhere, their influence on crime location choice likely depends upon one another. Interactions between two activity nodes-residential area of (1) offenders, (2) offenders' family-and two criminal opportunity indicators-number of bars/restaurants/hotels, collective efficacy-were tested and found (N = 13,088 any-crime-type offences committed by 5377 offenders): both residential area types were more often targeted than areas where offenders/family did not live, with no/lesser difference between low versus high criminal opportunity. Areas where offenders/family did not live were statistically significantly least often targeted when criminal opportunity there was low.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2018,58,5,1171,1192,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azx049,,22/02/2024
14,y,Do Street Robbery Location Choices Vary Over Time of Day or Day of Week? A Test in Chicago,"Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week. Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2017,54,2,244,275,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427816680681,,22/02/2024
15,t,A framework for estimating crime location choice based on awareness space,"This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders' previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders' knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location's crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies.",,2193-7680,2020,9,1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40163-020-00132-7,,22/02/2024
16,y,ROLE OF THE STREET NETWORK IN BURGLARS' SPATIAL DECISION-MAKING,"Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that taste preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2017,55,2,344,376,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12133,,22/02/2024
17,n,Revisiting the choice model of Ponzi and Pyramid schemes: analysis of case law,"This exploratory study operationalizes the variables comprising the choice model of white collar crime through analyzing cases decided by federal courts, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Cases were extracted from the LEXIS-NEXIS, WESTLAW, and the NERA Economic Consulting databases and categorized according to the indicators of the choice model: size of pool of criminally predisposed, supply of lure, prevailing beliefs about credibility of external oversight, internal oversight and self-restraint, and supply of criminal opportunities. The findings show that unequal access to information among the investors and misuse of trust and affinity relationships affected the size of the pool of criminally tempted individuals. Supply of lure was affected through advances in modern technology and promises of wealth and material success at low costs and risks. Prevailing beliefs about the credibility of external oversight and internal corporate regulatory controls were affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement authorities. Variables described by the choice model of white collar crime can be operationalized through analysis of existing case law.",0925-4994,1573-0751,2013,60,4,375,400,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10611-013-9456-8,,22/02/2024
18,y,Formal Evaluation of the Impact of Barriers and Connectors on Residential Burglars' Macro-Level Offending Location Choices,"Previous research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.",0004-8658,1837-9273,2009,42,2,139,158,http://dx.doi.org/10.1375/acri.42.2.139,,22/02/2024
19,only used distance,Crime location choices: A geographical analysis of German serial killers,"The present study examined whether there are different processes operating in the crime location choices between body-disposing and non-body-disposing serial killers and between sexual serial killers and acquisitive serial killers. A sample of 49 series of solved German serial killings is used to examine the differences in travelled distances between these groups of killers. Nonparametric tests revealed that body-disposing and non-body-disposing serial killers and sexual and acquisitive serial killers did not constitute subgroups of serial killers regarding their spatial behaviour. The results suggest that the compared groups are subjected to the same factors that influence their travelled distances. Furthermore, the possible role of planning and anticipated emotions in crime location choices of serial killers is discussed, as well as the limitations of the study and recommendations for future research.",1544-4759,1544-4767,2019,16,2,110,123,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jip.1521,,22/02/2024
20,n,Shame and rational choice in offending decisions,"This study examined the effects of shame proneness and two types of anticipated shame states-shame due to exposure and shame without exposure-in a rational choice model of offending intentions. Using scenario-based survey data from a sample of university students, it was found that (a) anticipated shame states without exposure reduced intentions to drive drunk and shoplift and (b) anticipated shame states due to exposure reduced shoplifting intentions. By contrast shame proneness had a positive effect on decisions to commit both drunk driving and shoplifting. The findings support the rational choice model of offending and indicate that the effects of shame are important components in individuals' decisions to offend.",0093-8548,1552-3594,1997,24,2,234,255,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0093854897024002006,,22/02/2024
21,y,Crime Feeds on Legal Activities: Daily Mobility Flows Help to Explain Thieves' Target Location Choices,"ObjectiveAccording to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.MethodsGeocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.ResultsAccounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender's home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.ConclusionsThe mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2019,35,4,831,854,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-019-09406-z,,22/02/2024
22,q,Structural predictors of choice: Testing a multilevel rational choice theory of crime,"Extant research has provided support for the micro-level predictions of rational choice models of crime. Yet, a central feature of the rational choice perspective in the broader social sciences-that it is multilevel in focus, situating individuals within broader community social structures-has been neglected within criminology. In this article, we discuss and test a model that links community structural characteristics to several individual expectations and preferences relevant to crime. Using data from the Pathways to Desistance study, we find that objective levels of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage influence individuals' perceptions of, and preferences for, the risks, costs, and rewards associated with offending indirectly by affecting perceived disorder and perceived opportunities for legitimate avenues of success within one's neighborhood. The implications of a multilevel rational choice model of offending are discussed.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2022,60,4,606,636,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12314,Jul-22,22/02/2024
23,n,Examining Police Effectiveness as a Precursor to Legitimacy and Cooperation with Police,"Numerous studies by Tyler and colleagues, as well as other scholars, support a normative, process model to account for variation in the public's cooperation with police in the USA and other developed nations. However, a recent study in Ghana suggests that in developing countries fraught with high levels of violent crime and corruption, cooperation may instead be accounted for by a utilitarian, rational-choice model. Our study examines whether public cooperation with police in the developing nation of Trinidad and Tobago is associated with the process model or rational-choice model. Using in-person structured interviews with residents, we examined whether victims' decisions to report to police were related to individuals' perceptions about police effectiveness or police legitimacy. We found support for the process model. We discuss possible explanations for the divergence with Tankebe's research in Ghana and suggest avenues for future research.",0741-8825,,2013,30,5,895,925,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2011.633544,,22/02/2024

This paper extends this work by investigating the impact of New Jersey's BAC legislation on total and disaggregated crash fatalities. The results from the interrupted times series analyses show that reducing the BAC limit to 0.8 has no effect on total or driver fatalities, but has a negative and lasting effect on passenger fatalities.

Drawing on the 2000 Taiwan Areas Criminal Victimization Survey, the results of the current study showed a moderate effect of the opportunity model on Taiwan's burglary victimization. Also, this study found both consistent and conflicting findings in the current data. The null effect of motorcycles (including scooters) that represented the concept of target attractiveness in relation to burglary risk reflected a difference in population density and transportation needs between Taiwan and the West.

28,n,The Efficacy of Ideographic Models for Geographical Offender Profiling,"Current 'geographical offender profiling' methods that predict an offender's base location from information about where he commits his crimes have been limited by being based on aggregate distributions across a number of offenders, restricting their responsiveness to variations between individuals as well as the possibility of axially distorted distributions. The efficacy of five ideographic models (derived only from individual crime series) was therefore tested. A dataset of 63 burglary series from the UK was analysed using five different ideographic models to make predictions of the likely location of an offenders home/base: (1) a Gaussian-based density analysis (kernel density estimation); (2) a regression-based analysis; (3) an application of the 'Circle Hypothesis'; (4) a mixed Gaussian method; and (5) a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis. These tests were carried out by incorporating the models into a new version of the widely utilised Dragnet geographical profiling system DragNetP. The efficacy of the models was determined using both distance and area measures. Results were compared between the different models and with previously reported findings employing nomothetic algorithms, Bayesian approaches and human judges. Overall the ideographic models performed better than alternate strategies and human judges. Each model was optimal for some crime series, no one model producing the best results for all series. Although restricted to one limited sample the current study does show that these offenders vary considerably in the spatial distribution of offence location choice. This points to important differences between offenders in the morphology of their crime location choice. Mathematical models therefore need to take this into account. Such models, which do not draw on any aggregate distributions, will improve geographically based investigative decision support systems.",0748-4518,,2013,29,3,423,446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-012-9186-6,,22/02/2024

Male students of legal drinking age participated in a randomized experiment in which intoxication and anger levels were manipulated. Participants read a bar fight scenario and completed a series of questions measuring aggressive intentions and the perceived consequences of violence. Results indicate that alcohol and anger interacted to increase one measure of aggressivity, but the perceived costs and benefits of violence were unaffected. Exploratory analyses call into question the robustness of the rational choice model, suggesting that the perspective may not be the general explanation for crime it is proclaimed to be.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2002,40,4,933,966,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2002.tb00978.x,,22/02/2024
30,n,Traveling Alone or Together? Neighborhood Context on Individual and Group Juvenile and Adult Burglary Decisions,"Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions.",0011-1287,1552-387X,2023,69,11,2075,2101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00111287211067177,Jan-22,22/02/2024
31,n,When to Refrain from Using Likelihood Surface Methods for Geographic Offender Profiling: An Ex Ante Test of Assumptions,"Likelihood surface methods for geographic offender profiling rely on several assumptions regarding the underlying location choice mechanism of an offender. We propose an ex ante test for checking whether a given set of crime locations is compatible with two necessary assumptions: circular symmetry and distance decay. The proposed (SDD) test compares the observed inter point distances of a given series of crimes with a theoretical distribution function governed by these assumptions, using a Monte Carlo simulation procedure for approximating that distribution function. We apply the SDD test to data on serial burglary from both the UK and the Netherlands. In most cases, the assumption of an underlying symmetric distance decay function has to be rejected.

32,y,Where Do Dealers Solicit Customers and Sell Them Drugs? A Micro-Level Multiple Method Study,"According to a rational choice theory of crime location choice, offenders commit crimes at locations where the mix of expected rewards and costs is optimal. The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crimeillicit drug dealing in an open air drug marketand tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were collected in interviews with 50 dealers of illicit drugs and through systematic observations of the 262 street segments in the study area. It was expected that dealers prefer locations where expected earnings relative to invested time and effort is high and where the risk of apprehension is low. The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control. Qualitative data collected in the same interviews reveal that dealers view social control as a nuisance and risk that can be evaded. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for criminological theory and research methods.",1043-9862,1552-5406,2015,31,4,376,408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1043986215608535,,22/02/2024
33,y,How do residential burglars select target areas? A new approach to the analysis of criminal location choice,"This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed.",0007-0955,,2005,45,3,296,315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azh070,,22/02/2024
34,y,"Location, Location, Location: Effects of Neighborhood and House Attributes on Burglars' Target Selection","Objectives To empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars' choice of residence to burglarize. Methods We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars' target choice in a conditional logit model. Results Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars' target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2020,36,4,779,821,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-019-09431-y,Oct-19,22/02/2024
35,y,Burglar Target Selection: A Cross-national Comparison,"Objectives: This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions. Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2015,52,1,3,31,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427814541447,,22/02/2024
36,n,An economy of choice? Terrorist decision-making and criminological rational choice theories reconsidered,"This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats.

37,n,Developments in Geographical Offender Profiling: Commentary on Bayesian Journey-to-Crime Modelling,"The Bayesian approach covered in this special issue complements the earlier ways of exploring offenders' crime location choices. It is different from earlier approaches in dealing directly with large local data sets of solved crimes to develop statistical models as compared with attempts to derive more generic ways of conceptualising an offender's geographical crime pattern. The two approaches can thus be seen to enshrine different epistemologies; the Bayesian being about a process for deriving patterns in geographically specific data sets, the earlier centre-of-gravity-oriented approaches seeking to establish general theories and principles that are broadly independent of any given locality. They are consequently sensitive to different types of bias in the data available. However, the interesting results achieved through the analysis of Bayesian patterns within crime data does further the consideration of the similarities across offenders in their use of locations for crime and thus has theoretical as well as practical implications. Therefore, these two approaches need to build on each other. This complementarity provides a useful example for other areas of Investigative Psychology.

38,n,Can the group disincentivize offending? Considering opt-out thresholds and decision reversals*,"Scholars generally agree that offending decisions occur in social context, with some suggesting that choice models should explicitly integrate the notion that the deviant actions of others can incentivize offending. In this study, we investigate whether group settings can also disincentivize deviant action via reverse bandwagon effects, where individuals reverse their offending decision and express an intention to opt out of the criminal act. Based on survey data from three universities using hypothetical scenarios about theft and fighting, we find evidence of opt-out thresholds. Our findings indicate that deviant groups can serve as both an incentive and a disincentive, and that the relationship between group size and the perceived utility of crime is more complicated than prior work has suggested. Moreover, we find that these self-reported opt-out thresholds vary across scenarios, indicating that socially interdependent decision-making processes may be situation specific. In the end, the study underscores the importance of acknowledging the social context in offending decisions and highlights that group effects may be more complex and nuanced than previously discussed.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2021,59,4,738,765,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12289,Aug-21,22/02/2024
39,n,Catch and release Predicting encounter and victim release location choice in serial rape events,"Purpose - Factors influencing crime location choices are not only significant to rape investigations, but they are especially important for geographic profiling. The purpose of the current study is to use temporal, hunting behavior, and modus operandi factors to determine those variables that influence the victim encounter and release locations in serial sexual crime. Design/methodology/approach - Due to the possible correlated nature of serial rapes, the authors use generalized estimating equations (GEE) on a sample of 361 rapes committed by 72 serial sex offenders. Findings - Results indicate that temporal factors, offender hunting behavior, and modus operandi strategies are significant predictors of both the victim encounter and release sites, but the importance of these factors varies depending on whether the location is in a residential land use area, a private site, inside location, or a site that is familiar to the offender. Practical implications - Police can learn from the current findings and apply them to subsequent rapes within a series by recognizing the timing of the offense, the type of hunting pattern and attack method used in prior sexual crimes committed by the same offender, and modus operandi strategies, to determine the type of location where the rapist is likely to offend next. Originality/value - This paper is the first attempt to predict factors related to both the encounter and the victim release site in serial rapes using GEE.",1363-951X,,2012,35,4,835,856,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13639511211275814,,22/02/2024
40,n,The assumption of rational choice theory in Alfred Adler's theory of crime: Unraveling and reconciling the contradiction in Adlerian theory through synthesis and critique,"Alfred Adler is often introduced and discussed incorrectly as one of Freud's students and as a psychoanalytic theorist in criminology and psychology textbooks. While thinkers such as Freud and Jung theorize about crime in tangential ways, as almost an afterthought to their accounts of neurosis and personality, Alfred Adler was one of the few pioneers in the history of psychology who had an actual theory of crime. Yet, Adler's writings on crime, its causes and assumptions have been largely overlooked in contemporary research. While Adler espoused the view that crime represents a useless response to the social demands of life, we argue that Adler's theory of crime presupposes a rational choice model of criminal behavior, thus mirroring the Classical School perspective on crime.

41,n,The effect of sexual arousal on expectations of sexual forcefulness,"Decisions to commit crimes are often made under the influence of visceral feelings such as anger or sexual arousal. Rational choice models of offender decision-making assume that individuals carl anticipate, in an unaroused state, their responses to such visceral feelings. This assumption is tested in an experiment in which sexually aroused and nonaroused males predict their own behavior in a date rape scenario. Aroused and nonaroused participants were asked a battery of questions designed to measure their perceptions of the costs and benefits of acting in a sexually aggressive manner, their level of arousal, and a probabilistic prediction as to how aggressively they would act in the conditions described in the scenario, The authors find that sexual arousal does increase subjects' expectations of their own sexual aggressiveness and that this impact is not mediated by perceptions of the costs or benefits of such aggression.",0022-4278,1552-731X,1997,34,4,443,473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427897034004003,,22/02/2024

Geographic and series development data, as well as information on age, intelligence, motive, marital status, employment status, and mode of transportation of 53 German serial murderers was collected from police and prosecution service files and judicial verdict records. Potential effects of the aforementioned factors on spatial decisions were assessed. Results showed that 63% of the murderers lived within 10 km of their crime locations. Home-to-crime distance was negatively correlated with murderer age and positively correlated with murderer IQ score. Results also showed that the mode of transportation used by murderers had an effect on their spatial decisions. Results are discussed in terms of understanding serial murderer spatial decision-making and implications for police investigations.

43,y,Relative Difference and Burglary Location: Can Ecological Characteristics of a Burglar's Home Neighborhood Predict Offense Location?,"Objectives: Neighborhood characteristics predict burglary targets, but target attractiveness may be colored by the conditions in which a potential offender resides. We test whether relative differences in concentrated disadvantage, racial/ethnic composition, and ethnic heterogeneity influence where burglars offend, controlling for distance. From a relative deprivation perspective, economically advantaged areas make more attractive targets to burglars residing in disadvantage neighborhoods, but a social disorganization perspective predicts areas lower in social cohesion are most attractive, which may be neighborhoods with greater disadvantage. Methods: Drawing upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in the City of Tampa, Florida from 2000 to 2012, we utilize discrete choice modeling to predict burglar offense destination. Results: Offenders target neighborhoods that are geographically proximate or ecologically similar to their own. When accounting for relative differences, burglars from all neighborhood types are more likely to target highly disadvantaged or heterogeneous neighborhoods. Conclusions: Burglars generally select targets that are similar to their residence. However, when suspects do discriminate, there is evidence that they target neighborhoods that are worse off relative to their own on characteristics such as residential instability, disadvantage, racial composition, and racial/ethnic diversity. These neighborhoods are associated with lower social control and lower risk of detection.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2016,53,6,872,906,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427816647993,,22/02/2024
44,n,"Good guys, bad guys: transnational corporations, rational choice theory and power crime","While its scope and scale can be exaggerated, the power transnational corporations (TNCs) exert in the contemporary world is considerable. This is often at the expense of states, or at least is exercised in a way that can undermine states. Some interactions between corporations and states or their officers constitute prime examples of power crime. A blatant form is where corporations either offer or else agree to pay bribes to state officials in order to secure a major contract. This capacity to corrupt state officials via large scale bribes gives corporations significant potential power. This article begins by citing allegations of active corruption of state officials by TNCs, as well as counter-examples (i.e. where TNCs have taken a stand against rent-seeking officials). It then argues that active corruption by corporations constitutes a major dimension of power crime, and seeks to explain apparently contradictory behaviours by TNCs, relating these to rational choice theories and neo-liberalism. It is argued that recent changes in corporate governance and behaviour have made rational-choice models and simplistic neo-liberalism either questionable or redundant. Bu at the same time, globalisation and its stable mate neo-liberalism encourage improper behaviour-various forms of power crime-by corporations.",0925-4994,1573-0751,2009,51,03-Apr,383,397,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10611-008-9166-9,,22/02/2024

Theoretically, we draw special attention to the relevance of utility components for criminal decision making, while the empirical focus is on the formulation of an adequate statistical model for two-stage sequential decision processes. Empirical analyses are based on data collected by means of a mail survey (n = 2,383) of a disproportionally stratified random sample of residents from an East German city. For hypothesis testing, we estimate a series of sequential logit-models from the general class of discrete choice models (Hensher et al. 2005; Train 2009). Results indicate that aspects of utility guide actions on both stages of the decision process.

Data for this study are based on 439 merchant compliance checks in Ontario. At the bivariate level, our analysis reveals that enforcement activity has a significant negative effect on sales to miners. This effect, however, is slightly weakened with the introduction of background factors (i.e., rural/urban distinction, type of business operation), and all but eliminated once event factors are taken into consideration. The event factors which have the strongest independent effects on sales are: time of day (evening), age and gender composition of the youth attempting to purchase, and the legal compliance behaviour of tobacco merchants (asking for age and ID). These findings help to support a rational choice model of offending, and suggest that the situational context of the criminal event relates strongly to decisions to offend. In addition, our research suggests potential policy changes to reduce the illegal distribution and sale of tobacco to minors.",0704-9722,,2000,42,1,1,20,,,22/02/2024
47,n,"Ransomware: How attacker's effort, victim characteristics and context influence ransom requested, payment and financial loss","In recent years, ransomware attacks have led to disastrous consequences for victims, not just due to the payment ransom amount but also due to the recovery costs associated with these attacks. So far only a few empirical studies have analysed the financial impact of ransomware attacks. This study aims to understand the expected financial gains for attackers and financial losses of victims after a ransomware attack. To do so, we build a dataset based on 453 ransomware attack investigation reports in the Netherlands reported to the Dutch Police between 2019 and 2022. Using rational choice model of crime (RCM) and crime scripting we hypothesise that the effort of an attacker, victim characteristics and context variables influence not only the ransom requested by an attacker but also the financial losses reported by victims. We use generalised linear models to evaluate and quantify this influence. Our results show that attacker's efforts such as using Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and victim characteristics such as industry sector, contribute to the ransom requested by attackers and financial losses reported by victims. We also show that the availability of recoverable backups explains the likelihood of victims paying the ransom. A limitation of the present study is the interpretation of the results due to selection bias of victims willing to report to the police. Despite this limitation, we argue that our methodology and results lay the groundwork for future large-scale empirical studies and add to our understanding of attacker and victim behaviour.",2159-1237,,2022,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/eCrime57793.2022.10142138,,22/02/2024

Method A bi-variate dynamic binary choice model is developed to allow for interactions between employment and crime. The model takes into account statistical aspects such as state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. Results For a sample of N = 493 JSO, who are observed in early adulthood, age 18 until 28, we find significant negative predictive effects for employment on property offending and vice versa. For other types of offenses, the model indicates that the negative correlation with employment is due to spurious effects. This holds for all ages, but the negative effect of employment on property offending becomes stronger for the older cohorts, while the effect of property offending on employment decreases in magnitude. Employment duration is found to be a mild moderating factor. Conclusion The evidence in favor of bidirectional negative relationships among offending and employment that increase in magnitude with age suggests the importance of theories that emphasize cumulative (dis)advantage, such as social control theory.",2199-4641,2199-465X,2017,3,4,440,467,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40865-017-0064-7,,22/02/2024
49,n,Sentencing in light of collateral consequences: Does age matter?,"Purpose: Most sentencing studies control for offender age, but we know little about how age influences alternative sentencing outcomes, especially those that can mitigate the collateral consequences of conviction. Theories predict varying effects of age based on the focal concerns issues of blameworthiness, community protection, and practical constraints, and prior findings on main and interactive age effects are mixed. Methods: This study draws on Florida sentencing data (N = 240,844) spanning 2000-2006 to examine how offender age influences the avoidance of a felony label by the withholding of adjudication, for defendants convicted of a felony and sentenced to probation. Logistic regression and heterogeneous choice models are used to examine the effects of age on the predicted log-odds of having adjudication withheld. Results: The results demonstrate a curvilinear age relationship with adjudication withheld, protecting youthful and, to a lesser extent, older offenders from felony labels. This non-linear relationship is robust to interactions with gender, race/ethnicity, and offense type, illustrating the importance of age and the need for additional research to examine its effects more fully. Conclusions: The evidence suggests that age plays an important role in decisions to utilize alternative sanctions in the criminal justice system. The youngest and oldest offenders benefit the most, while adults face the harshest consequences and are less likely for consideration of alternative sentencing options. These results hold important policy implications in light of criminogenic trajectories for youthful offenders, systems burdened with aging prisoner populations and theoretical perspectives on age, sentencing and collateral consequences.",0047-2352,1873-6203,2017,53,,1,11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2017.07.009,,22/02/2024

We use the distinctive features of social welfare for identification. We consider a sample of disadvantaged males from The Netherlands who are observed between ages 18 and 32 on a monthly time scale. We simultaneously model the offending, employment and social welfare variables using a dynamic discrete choice model, where we allow for state dependence, reciprocal effects and time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. We find significant negative bi-directional structural effects between employment and property crime. Robustness checks show that only regular employment is able to significantly reduce the offending probability. Further, a significant uni-directional effect is found for the public assistance category of social welfare on property offending. The results highlight the importance of economic incentives for explaining the relationship between employment and crime for disadvantaged individuals. For these individuals the crime reducing effects from the public assistance category of social welfare are statistically equivalent to those from employment, which suggests the importance of financial gains.

Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets ? What keeps them away from certain areas ? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out.

53,n,Corporate self-policing and the environment,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Self-Policing Policy (more commonly referred to as the Audit Policy) waives or reduces penalties when regulated entities voluntarily discover, disclose, and correct environmental violations. This study draws upon a rational choice model of corporate crime to determine if traditional regulatory efforts such as inspections and enforcement actions are associated with the odds of disclosing an environmental violation under the Audit Policy. A case control design is used to compare companies that self-police to companies that do not self-police. The event group consists Of all 551 companies that disclosed at least one environmental violation under the Audit Policy between October 1, 1998 and September 30, 2000. The control group consists of a simple random sample of 551 companies that did not use the Audit Policy but were discovered to have violated at least one environmental law during the same time period as the event group. There is no evidence that inspections and enforcement increase Audit Policy use. However, the results do suggest, first, that the Audit Policy is more likely to be used by large companies than by small companies and, second, that it is likely to be used for reporting violations as opposed to more serious emissions or permit violations. In terms of public policy these findings suggest that regulatory agencies such as the EPA can do relatively little to increase the self-policing of environmental violations.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2006,44,3,671,708,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2006.00060.x,,22/02/2024
54,y,TARGET CHOICE DURING EXTREME EVENTS: A DISCRETE SPATIAL CHOICE MODEL OF THE 2011 LONDON RIOTS,"Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevailcrime pattern and social disorganization theoryand consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2013,51,2,251,285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12004,,22/02/2024
55,n,An Examination of the Home-Intruder Sex Offender,"One particular crime location in sexual assaults is the victim's residence. Similar to sexual burglars, home-intruder sex offenders choose to assault the victim in her residence, most likely in their bedroom. The aim of the current study is to analyze modus operandi, temporal factors, and victim characteristics in a sample of 347 stranger sexual assaults committed by 69 serial sex offenders to determine which factors may be more relevant to sexual assaults committed in the victim's residence compared with sexual assaults committed at another type of location. Our hypothesis is that offenders who choose to sexually assault victims in their home constitute a specific type of sex offender, one that resembles the sexual burglar. Results showed that modus operandi (e.g., burglary), temporal factors (e.g., time at crime scene with victim), and victim characteristics (e.g., age, victim-offender relationship) were significant in predicting whether the victim encounter, crime site, and victim release site were located at the victim's residence or not. Moreover, these findings were generally significant across the three crime locations, which can be explained by the high consistency in location during home-intrusion sexual assaults. Situational crime prevention strategies aimed at making a residence less attractive for offenders should help reducing this particular type of sexual assault.",0306-624X,1552-6933,2018,62,14,4694,4713,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624X18778450,,22/02/2024
56,n,The illegal sale of prescription drugs for enhancing cognitive performance A vignette-based study of rational and normative causes,"The illicit sale of prescription drugs for enhancing cognitive performance is a criminal act which has hardly been studied although the consumption of these drugs by healthy people has numerous negative individual and social consequences. In this study, we scrutinize the decision to sale those drugs based on assumptions of various criminological rational choice models, self-control theory, social norms, as well as the Model of Frame Selection (MFS) and the Situational Action Theory (SAT). Thereby, we also consider interactions between instrumental incentives, self-control and norms. To investigate decisions regarding the illegal sale of performance enhancing drugs, we used a web-based survey among students at four German universities (N=1,698). Each respondent received randomly one out of 900 vignettes, in each case describing a hypothetical sales situation concerning the illegal and financially rewarding transmission of medications to enhance concentration between students. The descriptions have been randomly varied with respect to the sales profits and the severity of punishments and their respective probabilities. Moreover, the degree of self-control and internalized norms regarding illegal sales have been assessed. The results, that are derived from double hurdle models, show that, especially, internalized norms as well as the severity of punishment reduce the willingness of selling, while low self-control and increasing profits increase this willingness. In addition, a negative interaction effect between low self-control and the severity of punishment shows that a more severe punishment leads to more deterrence when self-control is lower (respectively that with more sever punishments, the impact of self-control decreases). Although the results support the theoretical assumptions only partially, we can show that internalized norms significantly influence the perception of criminal behavior while the benefits of such behavior and self-control seem to operate in a downstream deliberation process.",0026-9301,2366-1968,2018,101,03-Apr,352,379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mks-2018-1013-408,,22/02/2024

Drawing on routine activity theory, disorder theory, and social disorganization theory, the study explores potential mechanisms that link foreclosures to crime. Methods: To estimate the relationship between foreclosures and localized crime, we use detailed foreclosure and crime data at the blockface level in Chicago and a difference-in-difference estimation strategy. Results: Overall, mortgage foreclosures increase crime on blockfaces. Foreclosures have a larger impact on crime that occurs inside residences than on crime in the street. The impact of foreclosures on crime location varies by crime type (violent, property, and public order crime). Conclusions: The evidence supports the three main theoretical mechanisms that link foreclosure activity to local crime. The investigation of the relationship by crime location suggests that foreclosures change the relative attractiveness of indoor and outdoor locations for crime commission on the blockface.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2015,52,5,717,746,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427815572633,,22/02/2024
58,n,Valuing the public's demand for crime prevention programs: a discrete choice experiment,"Objectives The objectives of the study were (a) to utilize a state-of-the-art survey methodology previously employed in the environmental, health, and safety economics literatures to estimate the cost of violent crime and homicide in Buenos Aires and (b) to demonstrate the feasibility of this method for crime cost estimation and for using these surveys in developing countries. Methods The study used a random sample of households from an online panel in Buenos Aires. Respondents were asked to choose among three options with factorial design varying homicide rate, violent crime rate, policy measures to reduce crime, and tax impact (with one option being status quo). Discrete choice modeling was utilized to estimate willingness-to-pay for reduction in risk of homicide and violent crime as well as independent values for two policy options. Results The cost of homicide in Buenos Aires is estimated to be approximately $1.5 million, whereas the cost of other violent crimes (including rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) is estimated to average $2000. In addition to extending intangible crime cost estimates to Latin America, we simultaneously estimate the value of two comprehensive crime control policies, with values ranging from $600 to $700 million/year, about $12 per household per month each. Conclusion Discrete choice experiments can be credibly adopted to estimate the cost of crime. We implement this method in a Latin American country, where the estimated costs in Buenos Ares are consistent with those found in developing countries once controlling for income differences. These subjective crime cost valuations are significantly higher than tangible crime costs and, thus, provide a significant improvement in the ability of policy makers to conduct social benefit-cost analysis.",1573-3750,1572-8315,2019,15,4,529,550,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11292-019-09378-x,,22/02/2024
59,n,Examining Juvenile Delinquency within Activity Space: Building a Context for Offender Travel Patterns,"Researchers modeling offender travel patterns typically assume that crime locations are well within the offenders' activity space. Using information about the places frequented by 2,563 delinquent youths residing in Southern California, this study examined distances traveled to delinquent and nondelinquent hangout locations. Travel to known delinquent sites was substantively farther from home than expected and exhibited a segmented nonlinear curve, joining logarithmic and negative exponential functions. Significant variation was found for place-specific (trip distance) and person-specific (individual travel) distances by city classification, travel method, and age cohort; age effects disappeared in multivariate analyses. Several implications follow, highlighting the need to infuse a place-oriented approach to studying journey-to-crime.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2011,48,3,472,506,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427810393014,,22/02/2024
60,n,Spatial and Environmental Consistency in Serial Sexual Assault,"This study examines the crime patterns of 76 New Zealand serial sexual offenders in order to determine the extent to which offenders display locational consistency in their choice of crime locations. More specifically, the hypothesis was that there would be intraseries consistency in the distances travelled (spatial consistency) and the characteristics of the crime sites selected (environmental consistency) by serial sexual offenders. For spatial consistency to be tested, the distances travelled from home to offend and the criminal range for each offence series were analysed. Support was found for spatial consistency, and, in line with much overseas research, it was also found that the offenders typically did not travel very far from home to offend (median distance of 3 km). The environmental consistency measure was made up of various physical, temporal, and contextual variables that described the environmental characteristics of an offence. As hypothesised, it was found that offenders displayed intraseries environmental consistency in offence site selection beyond the level of that expected by chance. The implications of this both for understanding offender spatial decision making and for geographical profiling are discussed.

61,n,Crime Diversity: Reexamining Crime Richness Across Spatial Scales,"Although much of the crime and place literature seeks to explain crime frequency in relation to environmental conditions, few studies have examined crime diversity in space. This article reexamines a study of crime diversity in relation to a neutral model assuming environmental conditions have minimal influence on crime patterns. The original study results show that the variety of crime types in a given area (i.e., crime richness) increases regularly across spatial scales, and is largely consistent with a neutral or random process. This conclusion makes no appeal to the crime-environment dependencies often believed to influence crime occurrence, making the study a worthy candidate for additional scrutiny. The current study first verifies the original study results in Los Angeles, CA, and demonstrates their robustness with alternative crime classification schemes. Next, two alternative methods are used to check whether results differ when (a) locations are sampled randomly from the entire city rather than observed crime locations, and (b) when the unit of analysis is grid cells rather than ''point-buffers'' Finally, all analyses are replicated in St. Louis, MO, as a first look at generalizability. Conclusions are largely consistent with the original study, but important differences arise when alternative sampling techniques and units of analysis are used.

62,n,Are mobile offenders less likely to be caught? The influence of the geographical dispersion of serial offenders' crime locations on their probability of arrest,"Why is it that some offenders get arrested quickly, while others manage to evade arrest much longer or are never arrested at all? What characterizes serial offenders who continue to escape arrest? To be able to answer these questions, arrested (identified) offenders must be compared with never arrested (unidentified) offenders. DNA data offer a unique opportunity to compare crime series of identified offenders with crime series of unidentified offenders. In this paper, data from the Dutch DNA database are used to study whether the geographical dispersion of the crime locations of serial offenders influences the probability of arrest. Results show that the probability of arrest decreases with increasing geographical dispersion, measured as the number of police regions in which the offender's crimes have been committed.",1477-3708,,2013,10,2,168,186,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1477370812464533,,22/02/2024

Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i.e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i.e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i.e., event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders.

64,n,THE INFLUENCE OF ACTIVITY SPACE AND VISITING FREQUENCY ON CRIME LOCATION CHOICE: FINDINGS FROM AN ONLINE SELF-REPORT SURVEY,"Crime pattern theory predicts that offenders commit offences in their activity spaces. We also propose that they most likely offend in the more frequently visited parts. Previous studies wed offenders' residential areas or other activity space proxy measures but lacked data on other routinely visited places (e.g., work, school, and leisure activities). A major contribution of this study is the use of an online survey in which 78 offenders reported on their own activity spaces and committed offences (n = 140). Results show that offending is much more likely in offenders' activity spaces than elsewhere, and effects increase with visiting frequency. Although residential area is a good predictor, offenders' more extensive self-reported activity spaces predict much better where they commit offences.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2020,60,2,303,322,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azz044,,22/02/2024

To date, the majority fails to consider longitudinal aspects of campus crime. To address this gap, this study analyzed geographic similarity between property crime distributions across 3 years of police incident data for a metropolitan university in the southern USA and its surrounding community. Using ArcMap and a spatial test developed by Andresen (Appl Geogr 29(3):333-345, 2009), the degree of similarity between annual, seasonal, and semesterly spatial distributions of property crime were analyzed. The results indicated 41.2% of all property crimes occurred within 5% of locations. Significant levels of similarity for the seasonal and semesterly distributions of on-campus property crime were found, which largely became nonsignificant once zero-crime locations were removed. None of the annual analyses, nor the analyses of the campus and its surrounding community reached a significant level of similarity. The implications of these findings are discussed.",1460-3780,1743-4629,2020,22,2,110,133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41300-020-00087-6,Feb-20,22/02/2024
66,n,Allocating Police Resources While Limiting Racial Inequality,"Police targeting hot spots of crime tends to disproportionately burden minorities via stops and arrests. This work attempts to reduce disproportionate minority contact by formulating a crime hot spots spatial allocation strategy for police that prioritizes areas of high crime, but constrains the targeted hot spots given different levels of acceptable racial inequality. This racial inequality constraint is measured as the proportion of minorities likely to be stopped in those areas prioritized by police. Using data on stops and crime in New York City, I show that police stops can be more equitably distributed according to race, but there are fundamental trade-offs. One cannot gain a racial distribution of stops proportionately equal to the residential population without large decreases in the efficiency of targeting high crime areas. More modest gains can be had though in reducing the proportion of minorities stopped while still targeting high crime locations.",0741-8825,1745-9109,2020,37,5,842,868,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2019.1630471,Jun-19,22/02/2024

This study fills this gap by conducting a department-wide hot spots patrol experiment in Louisville, Kentucky. The study used block randomization to identify 47 hot spot pairs, 24 pairs located in the city and 23 pairs in the suburbs. The intervention examined the impact of directed patrol across three difference-in-difference outcomes: crime-related calls for service (CFS), part 1 crimes, and soft crimes. Ordinary least squares regression results indicate the intervention did not have significant effect on the three outcomes; however, hot spot location impacted crime-related CFS.

It reports on an ethnographic study of two investigative departments (working on volume crime and domestic crime) located in Northern Sweden. Interviews (N= 27) and participant observations (N= 56) were conducted in order to examine how investigators approached and managed rural conditions in their daily work. Findings indicate that police investigations in rural areas are characterized by constraints, such as resource shortages, extended set-up times (due to travelling), and challenges in multitasking. The findings identify two main practices for investigating crime in such settings: 'rural investigation' that entails a decentralized approach in which investigators are embedded locally; and 'investigating the rural' that entails a distanced, centralized approach. This article discusses trade-offs and predicted outcomes in crime investigation and highlights how the urban/rural binary divide encompasses a paradoxical tension that investigators must manage continuously.",1752-4512,1752-4520,2021,15,2,1352,1366,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/police/paaa023,,22/02/2024

Although many works have concluded that biased offenders cause greater harms to their victims relative to unbiased perpetrators, this effect tends to be sensitive to individual and situational factors like victim and offender characteristics, bias motivation, weapon use, or crime location. This type of confounding has the potential to introduce selection bias in the estimation of victimization harms among biased criminal incidents. With data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (2010-2020), I use propensity scores and inverse-probability weighting to show that, on average, victims of bias motivated offenses are more likely to report later physical and emotional harms despite not suffering greater initial injury in incidence. Findings also demonstrate that the harm of hate varies across different bias motivations, with such crimes directed toward those on the basis of disability, gender, and sexual orientation causing greater short- and long-term individual trauma and damage.",0886-2605,1552-6518,2024,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08862605231222683,Jan-24,22/02/2024

76,,"Unravelling Crime Series Patterns amongst Serial Sex Offenders: Duration, Frequency, and Environmental Consistency","Crime linkage and the investigation of behavioural consistency amongst serial offenders has been a flourishing field of research over the past decade or so, especially with respect to serial sex offenders. The emerging research in this field has often portrayed serial sex offenders as a single, distinct, and homogeneous group. Such an assumption, however, has never been empirically examined. Using a criminal career approach and a sample of 72 serial sex offenders who have committed a total of 361 sexual assaults on stranger victims, the current study aims to examine and describe subgroups of crime series patterns amongst serial sex offenders in terms of duration and frequency of offending. The level of environmental consistency display (i.e. offender's choice of crime location and characteristics of the crime site selected) across subgroups of crime series patterns is also examined. Study findings suggest the presence and heterogeneity of crime series patterns amongst serial sex offenders, advocating for the consideration of subgroups of crime series patterns when studying serial sex offenders. Moreover, the offenders' level of environmental consistency varies across the different crime series patterns identified, allowing for the identification of subgroups of offenders showing a higher or lower level of environmental consistency.

77,,Testing the Stability of Crime Patterns: Implications for Theory and Policy,"Recent research in the crime at places'' literature is concerned with smaller units of analysis than conventional spatial criminology. An important issue is whether the spatial patterns observed in conventional spatial criminology focused on neighborhoods remain when the analysis shifts to street segments. In this article, the authors use a new spatial point pattern test that identifies the similarity in spatial point patterns. This test is local in nature such that the output can be mapped showing where differences are present. Using this test, the authors investigate the stability of crime patterns moving from census tracts to dissemination areas to street segments. The authors find that general crime patterns are somewhat similar at all spatial scales, but finer scales of analysis reveal significant variations within larger units. This result demonstrates the importance of analyzing crime patterns at small scales and has important implications for further theoretical development and policy implementation.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2011,48,1,58,82,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427810384136,,22/02/2024
78,,Deconstructing journey-to-crime?s questionable validity in theft-related crimes,"Purpose: This study empirically quantifies the methodological biases of the journey-to-crime measurement, by investigating the extent to which they affect its ability to estimate the itineraries offenders actually travel during the perpetration of their crimes.Methods: With the support of police-arrest records, interviews, and web-mapping technologies, the detailed route taken by 98 offenders during 449 theft-related crimes are reconstructed in order to test some of the key assumptions underlying journey-to-crime research.Results: Police data used to compute home-crime distances have been found to provide satisfactorily accurate crime-location addresses, but poorly accurate offender home-addresses. Several explanations of why the police have problems correctly identifying where an offender is truly residing on the day of a given crime are presented. Even if the offender's residence was the most important node in their crime journey, the actual travel undertaken by offenders was much more complex than the home-crime-home itinerary assumed by the journey-to-crime measurement.Conclusions: Despite its numerous drawbacks, the traditional journey-to-crime measure is still a valid and useful proxy for the total distance actually traveled by offenders in robbery and other theft, but not in burglary and motor-vehicle theft. Implications for criminal mobility research and future studies are discussed.",0047-2352,1873-6203,2023,86,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2023.102052,Mar-23,22/02/2024
79,,Crime patterns during the market transition in China,"A sizable literature on crime patterns during periods of social change and modernization has been developed. A number of theories have been proposed to explain variations in crime levels; these theories have largely been rooted in the classical Durkheimian theory of anomie. Most empirical studies of crime patterns examine levels of violent and property crimes and link variations in the levels of these crimes to indicators of social change and modernization using cross-national data. Moving beyond the conventional focus on levels of violent and property crimes, the present study focuses on whether rates of economically motivated crimes (e.g. larceny, grand larceny, robbery and fraud) increased faster than less or non-economically motivated crimes (e.g. homicide, assault and rape) during the period of social change from state socialism to a market economy in China. The study finds that economically motivated crimes have increased faster than less or non-economically motivated crimes. The paper is in favour of a structural explanation that expanding economic motivation is a driving force for economically motivated crimes during the transition to a market economy in China. This explanation is more consistent with the patterns of crime found than conventional anomie-based explanations in their accounting for the crime patterns.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2005,45,5,613,633,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azi044,,22/02/2024
80,,A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY TO CRIME: EFFECTS OF RESIDENTIAL HISTORY ON CRIME LOCATION CHOICE*,"Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offenders also might commit crimes near their former homes. Building on crime pattern theory and combining information from police records and other sources, this study confirms that offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in. In support of the argument that spatial awareness mediates the effects of past and current residence, it also is shown that areas of past and present residence are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived in the area for a long time instead of briefly and if the offender has moved away from the area only recently rather than a long time ago. The theoretical implications of these findings and their use for investigative purposes are discussed, and suggestions for future inquiry are made.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2010,48,2,389,416,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00190.x,,22/02/2024
81,,Predicting Initiator and Near Repeat Events in Spatiotemporal Crime Patterns: An Analysis of Residential Burglary and Motor Vehicle Theft,"Near repeat analysis has been increasingly used to measure the spatiotemporal clustering of crime in contemporary criminology. Despite its predictive capacity, the typically short time frame of near repeat crime patterns can negatively affect the crime prevention utility of near repeat analysis. Thus, recent research has argued for a greater understanding of the types of places that are most likely to generate near repeat crime patterns. The current study contributes to the literature through a spatiotemporal analysis of residential burglary and motor vehicle theft in Indianapolis, IN. Near Repeat analyses were followed by multinomial logistic regression models to identify covariates related to the occurrence of initiator (the first event in a near repeat chain) and near repeat (the subsequent event in a near repeat chain) events. The overall findings provide additional support for the argument that neighborhood context can influence the formation and context of spatiotemporal crime patterns.",0741-8825,1745-9109,2018,35,5,842,870,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2017.1342854,,22/02/2024

Officers are given 36 maps depicting three, five, or seven crime sites and topographical or no topographical details. They are asked to predict, by marking an X on the map, where they thought each burglar lived. After making their predictions on half of the maps, officers randomly receive either no training or training in one of two simple decision-making strategies. The accuracy of predictions at baseline and retest is measured as the distance between the predicted and actual home locations, and these accuracy scores are compared to a commonly used geographic profiling system. Results show that training significantly improved predictive accuracy, regardless of the number of crime locations or topographical detail presented. In addition, trained participants are as accurate as the geographic profiling system.",0093-8548,,2007,34,1,119,132,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0093854806290161,,22/02/2024
83,,Testing a rational choice model of airline hijackings,"Using data that combines information from the Federal Aviation Administration, the RAND Corporation and a newly developed database on global terrorist activity, we are able to examine trends in 1,101 attempted aerial hijackings that occurred around the world from 1931 to 2003. We have especially complete information for 828 hijackings that occurred before 1986. Using a rational choice theoretical framework, we use continuous-time survival analysis to estimate the impact of several major counterhijacking interventions on the hazard of differently motivated hijacking attempts and logistic regression analysis to model the predictors of successful hijackings. Some of these interventions use certainty-based strategies of target hardening to reduce the perceived likelihood of success. Others focus on raising the perceived costs of hijacking by increasing the severity of punishment. We also assess which strategies were most effective in deterring hijackers, whose major purpose was related to terrorism. We found support for the conclusion that new hijacking attempts were less likely to be undertaken when the certainty of apprehension was increased through metal detectors and law enforcement at passenger checkpoints. We also found that fewer hijackers attempted to divert airliners to Cuba once that country made it a crime to hijack flights. Our results support the contagion view that hijacking rates significantly increase after a series of hijackings closely clustered in time-but only when these attempts were successful. Finally, we found that the policy interventions examined here significantly decreased the likelihood of nonterrorist but not that of terrorist hijackings.",0011-1384,,2005,43,4,1031,1065,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2005.00032.x,,22/02/2024
84,,Situating Crime Pattern Theory Into The Explanation Of Co-Offending: Considering Area-Level Convergence Spaces,"Features of the environment including activity nodes and the level of connectivity in spaces help offenders develop awareness spaces for criminal opportunities. Based on arguments forwarded by Felson, the current study argues these environmental features also facilitate convergence spaces that promote interaction among offenders that increase the likelihood of group crime. Data include street connectivity measures from the Environmental Protection Agency and publicly available arrest information from Baltimore City (2013-16). Findings provide support for the influence of certain activity nodes and pedestrian-oriented street connectivity in explaining group crime.

85,,Does the Police-Monitored CCTV Scheme Really Matter on Crime Reduction? A Quasi-Experimental Test in Taiwan's Taipei City,"Although numerous public closed-circuit television (CCTV) initiatives have been implemented at varying levels in Taiwan's cities and counties, systematic evaluations of these crime reduction efforts have been largely overlooked. To address this void, a quasi-experimental evaluation research project was designed to assess the effect of police-monitored CCTV on crime reduction in Taipei City for a period of 54 months, including data for both before and after camera installation dates. A total of 40 viewsheds within a 100-m (328 feet) radius were selected as research sites to observe variations in four types of crime incidents that became known to police during the January 2008 to June 2012 period. While crime incidents occurring in both the target and control sites were reduced in frequency after CCTV installation, results derived from time-series analysis indicated that the monitoring had no significant effect on the reduction of property crime incidents with the sole exception of robbery. With respect to the effects of comparing target and control sites, the average Crime Reduction Quotient (CRQ) was 0.36, suggesting that CCTV has an overall marginal yet noteworthy influence. Viewed broadly, however, the police-installed CCTV system in Taipei City did not appear to be as efficient as one would expect. Conversely, cameras installed in some observation sites proved to be significantly more effective than cameras in other sites. As a recommendation, future researchers should identify how particular micro-level attributes may lead to CCTV cameras working more effectively, thereby optimizing location choices where monitoring will prove to be most productive.",0306-624X,1552-6933,2019,63,1,101,134,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624X18780101,,22/02/2024
86,,Predictability of gun crimes: a comparison of hot spot and risk terrain modelling techniques,"The current study was designed to assess the possible differences in the accuracy and precision of two methodological mapping techniques as predictors of future gun crimes in Little Rock, AR: (1) risk terrain modelling (RTM) and (2) nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh), a traditional hot spot technique, which relies on past crime to predict where future crime is likely to occur. Data from the Little Rock Police Department, the Little Rock Treasury Department and the 2000 census were used to examine Nnh hot spot and RTM methods of gun crime prediction. The RTM incorporated measures of crime generators and crime attractors, while Nnh hot spots were constructed from 2008 gun crime data. The two measures were compared using their predictive accuracy index (PAI) and recapture rate index (RRI) values. Six of the seven social and physical environmental measures in the RTM significantly predicted future gun crime locations and the Nnh hot spots predicted 7% of future gun crime. PAI and RRI values suggested the RTM was more precise than the Nnh hot spot technique and the Nnh hot spot technique was more accurate than the RTM technique. Relying on one spatial prediction technique may create problems with accuracy and reliability. Multiple techniques may be needed to fully assess the phenomenon. Accuracy is a potential limitation of RTM when compared to other techniques, however, RTM is more reliable than Nnh hot spots due to the inclusion of the environmental backcloth. The findings were discussed in relation to crime prediction and policing efforts.",1043-9463,1477-2728,2016,26,3,312,331,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10439463.2014.942851,,22/02/2024
87,,Detecting spatial movement of intra-region crime patterns over time,"Many of the traditional measures of the degree to which crime patterns change over space and time have limitations. In particular most are unable to determine any change in spatial crime pattern within an areal unit. Usually studies measure the change in crime levels in contiguous areas (expressed as discrete sub-divisions of a study area), but this can become problematic due to difficulties such as the Modi. able Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). This paper describes a technique developed to allow researchers to examine intra-study region changes in crime patterns between two time periods without the need to aggregate crime counts to within-city areal boundaries. The method presented uses a random point nearest neighbor test combined with a Monte Carlo simulation. The process resolves problems of patterning and the MAUP that are common with a number of spatial displacement and pattern movement studies. This technique is demonstrated with example data from a city-wide police burglary crackdown in the Australian capital.",0748-4518,,2005,21,1,103,123,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-004-1789-0,,22/02/2024
88,,Number of participants in multiple perpetrator sexual aggressions,"The present study aims to explore differences between lone, duo and 3+ group sexual aggressions by adult strangers from a Spanish sample based on victims' and offenders' socio-demographic characteristics and sexual offences. Additionally, the study aims to provide evidence of whether duo offences should be considered a different category that MPR and whether we can differentiate them from lone and 3+ group offenders. A sample of 400 sexual stranger offenders whose victims were women over 13 years of age has been analysed to find differences and predictive variables for lone (N = 298), duo (N = 43) and 3+ group (N = 59) sexual aggressions. Kruskal-Wallis tests and chi-squared analysis were used to compare the three groups and then multinomial logistic regression analysis were conducted to identify the predictive variables of group size. Results support previous studies comparing group sexual offences by its size; and that duos could be a singular category with more similarities with multiple perpetrator rape offences (age and ethnicity of offenders, similar violent control and sexual behaviour during the aggression). Some singularities have also been encountered, such as higher levels of alcohol and drug use of the perpetrators; severe consequences of their actions with more injuries to their victims; use of weapons; and less use of vehicles, which can be related to crime locations that are rarely outdoors.",1355-3259,2044-8333,2023,28,1,122,135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lcrp.12229,Sep-22,22/02/2024
89,,Finding a Serial Burglar's Home Using Distance Decay and Conditional Origin-Destination Patterns: A Test of Empirical Bayes Journey-to-Crime Estimation in The Hague,"Can we tell where an offender lives from where he or she commits crimes? Journey-to-crime estimation is a tool that uses crime locations to tell us where to search for a serial offender's home. In this paper, we test a new method: empirical Bayes journey-to-crime estimation. It differs from previous methods because it utilises an 'origin-destination' rule in addition to the 'distance decay' rule that prior methods have used. In the new method, the profiler not only asks 'what distances did previous offenders travel between their home and the crime scenes?' but also 'where did previous offenders live who offended at the locations included in the crime series I investigate right now?'. The new method could not only improve predictive accuracy, it could also reduce the traditional distinction between marauding and commuting offenders. Utilising the CrimeStat software, we apply the new method to 62 serial burglars in The Hague, The Netherlands, and show that the new method has higher predictive accuracy than methods that only exploit a distance decay rule. The new method not only improves the accuracy of predicting the homes of commuters-offenders who live outside their offending area-it also improves the search for marauders-offenders who live inside their offending area. After presenting an example of the application of the technique for prediction of a specific burglar, we discuss the limitations of the method and offer some suggestions for its future development.

90,,Measuring Crime Concentration Across Cities of Varying Sizes: Complications Based on the Spatial and Temporal Scale Employed,"We argue that assessing the level of crime concentration across cities has four challenges: (1) how much variability should we expect to observe; (2) whether concentration should be measured across different types of macro units of different sizes; (3) a statistical challenge for measuring crime concentration; (4) the temporal assumption employed when measuring high crime locations. We use data for 42 cities in southern California with at least 40,000 population to assess the level of crime concentration in them for five different Part 1 crimes and total Part 1 crimes over 2005-2012. We demonstrate that the traditional measure of crime concentration is confounded by crimes that may simply spatially locate due to random chance. We also use two measures employing different temporal assumptions: a historically adjusted crime concentration measure, and a temporally adjusted crime concentration measure (a novel approximate solution that is simple for researchers to implement). There is much variability in crime concentration over cities in the top 5 % of street segments. The standard deviation across cities over years for the temporally adjusted crime concentration measure is between 10 and 20 % across crime types (with the average range typically being about 15-90 %). The historically adjusted concentration has similar variability and typically ranges from about 35 to 100 %. The study provides evidence of variability in the level of crime concentration across cities, but also raises important questions about the temporal scale when measuring this concentration. The results open an exciting new area of research exploring why levels of crime concentration may vary over cities? Either micro- or macro- theories may help researchers in exploring this new direction.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2017,33,3,595,632,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-016-9328-3,,22/02/2024
91,,A Socioeconomic Edge Effect: Rational Crime in Small Areas of Sharp Socioeconomic Contrast,"Objectives: To determine whether criminogenic edges, as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study's findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an edge under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2021,58,2,123,150,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427820945009,Aug-20,22/02/2024
92,,The Spatial Effect of Police Foot Patrol on Crime Patterns: A Local Analysis,"A foot patrol program was implemented in Lower Lonsdale, British Columbia, in the summer of 2010 and continues today. As a part of assessing the foot patrol's effect on crime in the neighbourhood, the spatial similarity was examined by comparing the crime pattern before the foot patrol initiative (2007-2009) with the crime pattern during the foot patrol program (2010-2012). Considering these baseline and treatment data sets and a spatial point pattern test, the spatial similarity between two data sets is analyzed. In general, the continued presence of foot patrol appears to have created a concentration of crime in specific areas, rather than a diffusion effect. The areas that continued to experience increased crime during foot patrol presence were often in the catchment area, suggesting displacement does occur, or along the border between the catchment and primary patrol area.",0306-624X,1552-6933,2019,63,8,1446,1464,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624X19828586,,22/02/2024
93,,Crime under lockdown: The impact of COVID-19 on citizen security in the city of Buenos Aires,"Research Summary This paper studies the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown on criminal activity in the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Following quarantine restrictions, we find a large, significant, robust, and immediate decline in property crime reported to official agencies, police arrests, and crime reported in victimization surveys. We observe no significant change in homicides, and a significant increase in arrests for resistance to authorities. The decrease in criminal activity was greater in business and transportation areas, but still large in commercial and residential areas (including informal settlements). After the sharp and immediate fall, crime recovered but, by the end of 2020, it had not reached its initial levels. The arrest data additionally shows a reduction in the distance from the detainee's address to the crime location, and a fall in the number of detainees from outside the City of Buenos Aires. Crime became more local as mobility was restricted. Policy Implications We find no evidence that the reduction in the number of detainees from outside the City of Buenos Aires led to a displacement of crime to suburban areas. This result aligns with the hypothesis that focalized place-based interventions have the potential to reduce overall crime rates. Moreover, the increase in arrests for resistance to authorities at the checkpoints set up during the lockdown shows that the enforcement of mobility restrictions can cause frictions between citizens and police, negatively affecting police's legitimacy. We also find that the increased government presence for the provision of health and social services in informal settlements during the pandemic led, as a positive externality, to an additional decrease in crime.",1538-6473,1745-9133,2021,20,3,463,492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12555,Oct-21,22/02/2024
94,,Using Police Reports to Monitor Money Laundering Developments. Continuity and Change in 12Years of Dutch Money Laundering Crime Pattern Analyses,"This article is based on 4 Dutch Crime Pattern Analyses on money laundering reports. These reports are part of a four-yearly cycle that provides a periodic overview on organized crime in the Netherlands. The reports cover a time span of 12years, starting from 2004 till 2016. During this time period, stricter anti-money laundering laws and more awareness of, and subsequently, attention to the profits of organized crime, had led to a growing number of confiscations and convictions for money laundering. Although the Crime Pattern Analyses on money laundering reports are unsuitable to study displacement effects or other situational changes (lacking precise data), they are useful as a tool for comparison and further policy research. Findings show that several changes in money laundering methods and new types of facilitators did occur. Technology is the biggest driver behind the identified changes. However, it also turns out that over the years the same money laundering methods keep returning. In such cases, no innovation was found. Even with the advent of digital opportunities and crypto currencies, cash was still extensively used. The continuity in money laundering methods suggests that the risk of detection is quite low or the consequences are negligible.",0928-1371,1572-9869,2019,25,1,83,97,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10610-018-9379-0,,22/02/2024

Census block (N = 13,164) street robbery counts across four periods (6:45 a.m. to 9:59 a.m., 10:00 a.m. to 4:29 p.m., 4:30 p.m. to 9:14 p.m., and 9:15 p.m. to 6:44 a.m.) were modeled with 12 different potentially criminogenic places, 3 measures of illicit markets, 4 compositional control variables, and spatially lagged versions of the 12 potentially criminogenic places and population using simultaneously estimated negative binomial regression models. Differences in the magnitudes of the parameter estimates across the time periods were assessed with Wald tests. Overall, the patterns across the four models were mostly consistent with the effects hypothesized based on the study's crime pattern theory and time-geography theoretical frame; yet differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients were less pronounced than hypothesized. Overall, the results provide moderate support for the crime pattern theory and time-geography explanation of spatial-temporal robbery patterns; however, numerous points are raised for future crime and place research.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2015,53,3,457,483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12076,,22/02/2024
96,,Public response to community engagement patrols in high crime areas,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate an experiment to improve residents' opinions of the police in Portland, Oregon. Officers conducted community engagement patrols (CEPs) in 60 high-crime areas. The CEPs prioritized non-investigative contacts with community members to build trust and promote positive police-community interactions in designated high-crime locations. It is hypothesized that community members living in/near intervention sites would report greater exposure to officers, more positive interactions and feel more positively about police than residents in control areas. Design/methodology/approach In total, 90 crime hot spots were identified using crime reports and calls for service. Locations were randomized into three groups: 2 CEPs/day (n=30), 4 CEPs/day (n=30), and control (i.e. no supplemental patrols, n=30). Officers were dispatched to treatment locations via the computer-aided dispatch system for 90 consecutive days, resulting in 16,200 scheduled CEPs. Surveys were mailed to 11,760 households immediately after the intervention ended and 1,537 were returned (13.1 percent). Findings Residents from intervention areas reported a higher number of positive police contacts, whereas contacts that residents perceived as negative did not differ between the three conditions. Community attitudes, including perceived police legitimacy, were generally unaffected by CEP dosage. Originality/value This paper documents the outcomes of a large-scale field experiment seeking to improve public attitudes toward police using directed CEPs in crime hot spots. Whereas the intervention succeeded in providing more opportunities for positive contact with police, attitude change may necessitate longer-term strategies.",1363-951X,1758-695X,2019,42,5,917,930,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/PIJPSM-04-2019-0051,,22/02/2024

The effect of bike-sharing station implementation on robbery occurrence across weekly, biweekly, and monthly observations was estimated using repeated measures multi-level logistic regression models. Bike-sharing stations did not statistically significantly link to robbery occurrence in immediate or nearby street corner units after implementation.

98,,Using environmental criminology theories to compare 'youth misuse of fire' across age groups in New South Wales,"Youth misuse of fire is a substantive community concern. Despite evidence which indicates youths account for a significant proportion of all deliberately lit fires within Australia, an absence of up-to-date, contextually specific research means the exact scope and magnitude of youth misuse of fire within Australia remains unknown. Despite research suggesting commonalities exist between youth misuse of fire and juvenile offending more broadly, misuse of fire is rarely explained using criminological theory. In light of this gap, a descriptive analysis of youth misuse of fire within New South Wales was performed. Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory were tested to explain differences in misuse of fire across age groups. Results suggest these environmental theories offer useful frameworks for explaining youth misuse of fire in New South Wales. It is argued that the Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory can be employed to better inform youth misuse of fire policy and prevention efforts.",0004-8658,1837-9273,2017,50,1,100,122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0004865815596794,,22/02/2024
99,,Estimating the probability of local crime clusters: The impact of immediate spatial neighbors,"Purpose: To investigate the importance of immediate spatial neighbors when investigating local crime patterns. Methods: Local indicators of spatial association are used to identify local crime clusters. The classification scheme of these local crime clusters is then modeled in a multinomial logistic regression. Results: The results show that immediate spatial neighbors are important for understanding local crime patterns. Though (positive) spatial autocorrelation has long been known to be present with crime data, this analysis suggests that negative spatial autocorrelation (if present) has a significantly different implication. Generally speaking, when predicting a local crime cluster type, the immediate spatial neighbors are more important for correct prediction. As such, a low local crime area that is surrounded by high crime areas presents itself as a high crime area in the regression results. Conclusions: Therefore, efforts to understand the criminal nature of an area must not consider that area in isolation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results provide evidence that naturally occurring social media data may provide an alternative information source on the crime problem. This paper adds to the emerging field of computational criminology and big data in four ways: (1) it estimates the utility of social media data to explain variance in offline crime patterns; (2) it provides the first evidence of the estimation offline crime patterns using a measure of broken windows found in the textual content of social media communications; (3) it tests if the bias present in offline perceptions of disorder is present in online communications; and (4) it takes the results of experiments to critically engage with debates on big data and crime prediction.,0007-0955,1464-3529,2017,57,2,320,340,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azw031,,22/02/2024
101,,Does the Configuration of the Street Network Influence Where Outdoor Serious Violence Takes Place? Using Space Syntax to Test Crime Pattern Theory,"To examine the effect of the physical layout of the street network on the spatial distribution of outdoor serious violence. Crime pattern theory predicts crime would be more prevalent on more connected, accessible or traveled street segments, as these will be more likely to fall within an offender's awareness space. The distribution of incidents of outdoor murder, attempted murder and other near-lethal violent crimes that occurred in one London (UK) borough (N = 447 offenses) was analyzed. The space syntax methodology was used to estimate the to- and through-movement potential of individual street segments. Regression analyses showed higher levels of integration (a measure of to-movement potential) and choice (through-movement potential) were associated with greater odds of a street segment containing at least one crime. Risk was also higher for segments located near to segments with the highest global choice values. In contrast, connectivity (the number of other segments a street segment is adjacent to) was negatively associated with crime occurrence. As predicted, the configuration of the street network was associated with the spatial distribution of outdoor serious violence. Crime reduction measures should be targeted at high-choice street segments (typically main arteries) and segments nearby.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2017,33,2,397,420,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-016-9306-9,,22/02/2024
102,,Simulating spatial crime patterns: What do we learn in standard ecological studies of crime?,"Objectives: Given the spatial nature of offender and target behavior, what do standard ecological studies of crime aggregating measures to different geographic units actually tell us? Methods: This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets. Results: There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level.",0047-2352,1873-6203,2020,70,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2020.101727,,22/02/2024
103,,Offender Searches and Crime Events,"This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.",1043-9862,1552-5406,2015,31,1,53,70,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1043986214552608,,22/02/2024
104,,Spatiotemporal Analysis of Stadium-Related Theft: An English Case-Study,"Academic studies on football-related crimes have predominantly focused on violent crimes and fans engaged in these crimes. Unlike these studies which may be deemed a reflection of the traditional criminology in the football context, this paper examines the crime patterns focused on where and when theft crimes might occur on match days and why such patterns might emerge. Routine activities theory and crime pattern theory which are two related theories of environmental criminology provide a theoretical framework for the study. These two theories successfully reveal how the components of the social and physical environment provide the necessary conditions for stadium-related theft. Methodologically, for the spatial analysis of theft crimes, the methods of Kernel Density Estimation and spatial permutation test are employed; for the temporal analysis, a match adjusted temporal analysis is developed. Using the hotspotting technique around the Elland Road Stadium of Leeds United football team, it is suggested that theft crimes are not randomly distributed in time (match days and non-match days) and space. The risk of theft (per unit of time) is found to be particularly elevated at certain locations near to the stadium on match days, and for a window of time before, during and after matches take place. Analysing the spatial and temporal dimensions of stadium-related theft crime is likely to provide guidance about when and where to deploy officers by informing intelligence services.",2148-6646,2602-3911,2019,7,2,233,254,http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/JPLC2019-0021,,22/02/2024
105,,Identifying the nature of risky places for sexual crime: The applicability of crime pattern and social disorganization theories in a Canadian context,"Purpose: Using both crime pattern and social disorganization theories, the current study investigates the characteristics of those places that experience high counts of reported sexual crime to police. Methods: Socio-demographic factors, land use, specific sexual crime attractors, and ecological variables are used to predict dissemination areas with high counts of sexual crime within a large city using 2180 founded crime events retrieved from a Canadian police database. Results: Socio-demographic and ecological factors, as well as the presence of particular sexual crime attractors, characterize these neighborhoods. For example, dissemination areas that have higher percentages of female, male, and single residents, as well as higher counts of rental units, bars, and schools, experience more sexual crimes. Land use does not predict dissemination areas with high counts of sexual crime. Conclusions: Both crime pattern and social disorganization theories provide a framework within which the nature of sexual crime places can be better understood. This information could be used to empower community members as to the types of places that are the riskiest for crimes of this nature, as well as to create a conversation about interventions that could be put in place at both the secondary and tertiary levels to prevent future occurrences.",0047-2352,1873-6203,2018,57,,35,46,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2018.03.003,,22/02/2024
106,,An application of the rational choice approach to the offending process of sex offenders: A closer look at the decision-making,"Although the study of both offense processes and implicit theories provides in-depth knowledge about the decision-making of sex offenders, these studies focus solely on the internal psychological processes of the offender leading to the commission of a sexual assault. These studies neglect to look specifically at the offender's decision-making during the offense in interaction with the immediate situations encountered at the offense scene, such as the choices of behavior while interacting with the victim in a specific context. Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results show that sex offenders, even if traditionally described as irrational and impulsive individuals, are capable, up to a certain point, of an analysis of the costs/benefits related to their actions. Moreover, results emphasize the important role of situational factors, such as victim resistance, on the decision-making process of sex offenders. Implications of the results are briefly discussed in regard of clinical practice and crime prevention.",1079-0632,1573-286X,2007,19,2,115,133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11194-007-9043-6,,22/02/2024
107,,Unsolved cases of sexual assault involving children : An analysis of the commission process,"Sexual assaults involving children are one of the most serious kinds of aggression, but, despite the significant human and monetary resources available to police, some of these crimes remain unsolved. A non-discretionary perspective suggests that individuals who commit such crimes may adopt specific behaviors that increase their chances of avoiding detection. This study explores the role of an individual's choices and behavior (i.e., selecting victims who display certain characteristics, choosing particular kinds of places in which to commit crimes, the characteristics of the crime, and strategies adopted specifically to avoid arrest) on the resolution of the crime (i.e., solved or unsolved). The research is based on a sample of 309 cases of the rape of a child (200 solved and 109 unsolved) in France between 1982 and 2015. The sample was restricted to victims aged less than 16 years old who did not know their perpetrator at the time of the offense. Bivariate and multivariate analyses indicate that certain victim characteristics (e.g., victim was unsupervised), crime location characteristics (e.g., encounter, crime, and release of the victim took place at the same location), and offender behavior (e.g., range of sexual acts; strategy of approach) affected whether or not the crime was solved by police. This study also shows that most child abusers do not use explicit strategies to avoid police detection. The theoretical and practical implications of understanding criminal behavior and criminal investigation are discussed.",0316-0041,,2020,53,2,77,107,http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/1074189ar,,22/02/2024
108,,Space-time analysis of burglary in Beijing,"In recent years, in addition to the development of environmental criminology, how crime is distributed in space and have been broadly studied and numerous crime patterns have been discovered. These findings made significant contributions to the progress of problem-oriented policing policy, especially crime forecasting and deployment of police resource. However, for some reasons, this research, especially the spatial and temporal crime analysis, is still absent in China. Therefore, in this article, we collected 5-month burglary recordings in Beijing and use spatio-temporal analysing methods to investigate property offending patterns in the second largest city of China. Initially, descriptive methods are used to analyse the crime patterns in space and time separately; the results indicate that the offences are significantly clustered in space and consecutively correlated with past history in time. Following that work, a disease contagion testing strategy is used to investigate the burglary risk in space and time. The findings indicate that the offence risk communicates at least 3 weeks within 200 m of an offended place, which shows near-repeat pattern. At end of this article, the significance of environmental crime analysis to the crime prevention in China is discussed.

109,,Ordinary Business Impacts on Commercial and Residential Burglary,"Research on land use and burglary has focused on the presence of drinking places and other undesirable businesses. The current study examines how a variety of ordinary businesses are associated with commercial and residential burglary. We identify three characteristics of ordinary businesses: services locations (on-site or off-site), volume of transactions (higher to lower) and clientele (neighbourhood or beyond). Businesses providing services or products on-site, used frequently and serving neighbourhood residents displayed strong associations with increased risks of victimization. Findings demonstrate the importance of recognizing how ordinary businesses influence crime patterns.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2014,54,2,298,320,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azt064,,22/02/2024

Utilizing the Metro bike census and other data, we use negative binomial regression analysis to model the relationship between bike thefts and various station-and neighborhood-level risk factors that can either create or close off opportunities for bike thefts. The findings indicate that bike thefts around Metro stations are positively influenced by the number of targets, as measured by the number of bikes per station, and the presence of likely offenders, as measured by the volume of auto-related larcenies. Stations that have greater guardianship, as measured by the number of nearby businesses, are less likely to experience bike theft. The implications of these findings for theory, methodological considerations, and crime prevention are discussed. We suggest that bike racks can be placed in locations with greater informal guardianship, and discuss ways our findings can inform traditional interventions such as bike locking campaigns.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2018,31,1,226,246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41284-017-0096-z,,22/02/2024
111,,Testing a rational choice model of desistance: Decomposing changing expectations and changing utilities,"We argue that a rational choice framework can be used to explain declines in offending from adolescence to young adulthood in two ways. First, subjective expectations of offending can be age graded such that perceptions of rewards decrease and perceptions of risks and costs increase. Second, the marginal (dis)utility of crime may be age graded (e.g., preferences for risks, costs, and rewards). We examine changes in offending from adolescence to young adulthood among a subset of individuals from the Pathways to Desistance Study (N = 585) and employ a nonlinear decomposition model to partition differences in offending attributable to changing subjective expectations (X) and changing marginal utilities (beta). The results indicate that both have direct and independent effects on changes in offending over time. The results of a detailed decomposition on the subjective expectations also indicate that differences exist across the type of incentives. That is, the effect of changing expectations is attributed mainly to changes in perceived rewards (both social and intrinsic). Changing expectations of social costs and risk of arrest from offending have weak effects on changes in criminal behavior, which suggests that they must be accompanied by increases in the weight placed on these expectations to promote appreciable declines in offending.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2019,57,4,687,714,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12223,Aug-19,22/02/2024

Findings suggest that pathways, edges, areas with suitable targets, conservation posts, landcover, and prior incidents are related to fauna- and flora-related illegal activities, though this relationship varies by season, units of analysis, and study area (i.e., patrol-based compared with official designation).

Results show local-level variations in the spatial concentration of immigration in Vancouver CTs. The use of multiple measures of immigration showed substantive variations of immigrant settlement at the local level. Moreover, results reveal that while immigrant concentration patterns are stable over time and, thus, demonstrate ecological stability, property crime patterns shift from year to year. The spatial analytic approach utilized in this study provides support for the use of local-level spatial models and the multidimensional operationalization of the immigration variable even when their correlations are high. There is heterogeneity among immigrant groups, an important yet often overlooked aspect in assessments of immigration effects on crime.",1707-7753,1911-0219,2020,62,4,30,51,http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/cjccj.2020-0041,,22/02/2024

To fill this gap, this study employs a longitudinal design to measure variation in effect size and significance of identified near-repeat crime patterns across 13 rolling one-year time periods within a 2-year study period (January 2015-December 2016).

115,,A multilevel examination of the association between COVID-19 restrictions and residence-to-crime distance,"Restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted people's daily routine activities. Rooted in crime pattern and routine activity theories, this study tests whether the enactment of a Safer-at-Home mandate was associated with changes in the distance between individuals' home addresses and the locations of where they committed crimes (i.e., residence-to-crime distance). Analyses are based on violent (N = 282), property (N = 1552), and disorder crimes (N = 1092) reported to one police department located in a United States' Midwest suburb. Multilevel models show that residence-to-crime distances were significantly shorter during the Safer-at-Home order, compared to the pre- and post-Safer-at-Home timeframes, while controlling for individual and neighborhood characteristics. Additionally, these relationships varied by crime type. Consistent with the literature, the findings support the argument that individuals tend to offend relatively near their home address. The current findings extend the state of the literature by highlighting how disruptions to daily routine activities stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic led to alterations in crime patterns, in which analyses indicated shorter distances between home address and offense locations.",,2193-7680,2022,11,1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40163-022-00172-1,,22/02/2024

Results demonstrate that high sales volume links to high crime, even after controlling for local socio-economic status, the effects of retail businesses, and local crime trends.

117,,How do offenders choose where to offend? Perspectives from animal foraging,"Purpose. Research suggests that offender spatial decision-making is not random. However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example. Methods. Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour - central place foraging, Brownian walks and Levy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Levy walks, respectively. Results. Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Levy walks. Conclusions. The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Levy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed.",1355-3259,2044-8333,2014,19,2,193,210,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lcrp.12061,,22/02/2024

In the study described here, we investigated these two core postulates of the age-crime invariance thesis by comparing age-crime distributions in South Korea (SK) with the inverted J-shaped norm proposed by HG. Our analysis considered age-crime schedules for a number of offense types (e.g. homicide) and indexes (e.g. total, violent, and property) and across a variety of measures or statistical tests. The findings revealed considerable divergence in South Korea's age-crime patterns compared with the HG invariance norm. Instead, SK age-crime patterns parallel those for Taiwan (also a collectivist Asian country) as reported recently by Steffensmeier and colleagues (2017).

To accomplish this the study capitalizes on the natural experiment that occurs when offender's move, and uses a unique metric, the distance between sequential offenses, to determine if when an offender moves the offense location changes. Methods Using a sample of over 40,000 custodial arrests from Syracuse, NY between 2003 and 2008, this quasi-experimental design uses t test's of mean differences, and fixed effects regression modeling to determine if moving has a significant effect on the distance between sequential offenses. Results This study finds that when offenders move they tend to commit crimes in locations farther away from past offences than would be expected without moving. The effect is rather small though, both in absolute terms (an elasticity coefficient of 0.02), and in relation to the effect of other independent variables (such as the time in between offenses). Conclusions This finding suggests that the home has an impact on where an offender will choose to commit a crime, independent of offence, neighborhood, or offender characteristics. The effect is small though, suggesting other factors may play a larger role in influencing where offenders choose to commit crime.",0748-4518,,2012,28,4,587,606,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-011-9161-7,,22/02/2024

122,,Informal Social Control and Crime Events,"Informal social control at micro-level places such as addresses, collections of addresses, and streetblocks is a critical factor in understanding crime patterns. Historically, informal social control has been associated with community-level theories such as social disorganization, systemic theory, and collective efficacy. This article reviews several important streams of literature that address the role of informal social control in controlling crime at micro-level places. It begins with opportunity theories such as rational choice, routine activity, and crime pattern theories, which mention informal social control as playing a role in crime control. More detailed treatment of the role of informal social control is offered by theoretical work addressing eyes on the street and human territorial functioning. Together, these various theoretical perspectives provide the basis for the specification of mechanisms that reflect how informal social control can prevent crime events.

123,,Do sports stadiums generate crime on days without matches? A natural experiment on the delayed exploitation of criminal opportunities,"Crime pattern theory claims that busy places generate crime through immediate and delayed exploitation. In delayed exploitation, offenders notice criminal opportunities during opening hours but return to exploit them later. This study investigates delayed exploitation by testing whether soccer stadiums locally increase police-recorded property crime on non-game days. A soccer stadium closure created a natural experiment. We estimate linear regression difference-in-difference models to compare crime rates on non-game days around the stadium, before and after the closure. The closure reduced non-game day property crime beyond the citywide property crime drop. We conclude that criminogenic effects of busy places extend beyond their opening hours, confirming the delayed exploitation mechanism and that crime-prevention strategies should also target these places outside opening hours.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2019,32,1,1,19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41284-018-0142-5,,22/02/2024

Methods: The relationships among potentially criminogenic places and illicit markets and seasonal census block robbery counts in Philadelphia, PA, were explored using simultaneously estimated negative binomial regression models. The equality of predictors' effects on street robbery across seasons was subsequently tested using Wald's tests. Results: While many facilities and illicit markets were positively associated with street robbery, there were few seasonal differences in their effects.

125,,Spatiotemporal Crime Patterns Across Six US Cities: Analyzing Stability and Change in Clusters and Outliers,"Objectives Examine the degree of crime concentration at micro-places across six large cities, the spatial clustering of high and low crime micro-places within cities, the presence of outliers within those clusters, and extent to which there is stability and change in micro-place classification over time. Methods Using crime incident data gathered from six U.S. municipal police departments (Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and Seattle) and aggregated to the street segment, Local Moran's I is calculated to identify statistically significant high and low crime clusters across each city and outliers within those clusters that differ significantly from their local spatial neighbors. Results Within cities, the proportion of segments that are like their neighbors and fall within a statistically significant high or low crime cluster are relatively stable over time. For all cities, the largest proportion of street segments fell into the same classification over time (47.5% to 69.3%); changing segments were less common (4.7% to 20.5%). Changing clusters (i.e., segments that fell into both low and high clusters during the study) were rare. Outliers in each city reveal statistically significant street-to-street variability. Conclusions The findings revealed similarities across cities, including considerable stability over time in segment classification. There were also cross-city differences that warrant further investigation, such as varying levels of spatial clustering. Understanding stable and changing clusters and outliers offers an opportunity for future research to explore the mechanisms that shape a city's spatiotemporal crime patterns to inform strategic resource allocation at smaller spatial scales.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2023,39,4,951,974,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-022-09556-7,Aug-22,22/02/2024
126,,"AGE AND ITS RELATION TO CRIME IN TAIWAN AND THE UNITED STATES: INVARIANT, OR DOES CULTURAL CONTEXT MATTER?","Current empirical and theoretical understanding of the relation between age and crime is based almost entirely on data from the United States and a few prototypical Western societies for which age-specific crime information across offense types is available. By using Western databases, Hirschi and Gottfredson (1983) projected that the age distribution of crime is always and everywhere robustly right-skewed (i.e., sharp adolescent peak)a thesis that is both contested and widely accepted in criminology and social science writings. In the study described here, we tested this age-crime invariance thesis by comparing age-crime patterns in Taiwan (a non-Western Chinese society) with those in the United States. In light of Taiwan's collectivist culture versus the U.S. individualist gestalt, we anticipated more divergence than homogeneity in their age-crime schedules. Our findings show robust divergence in Taiwan's age-crime patterns compared with U.S. patterns and the reverted J-shaped norm projected by Hirschi and Gottfredson. Implications for research and theory on the age-crime relation and for studying human development or life-course topics more broadly are discussed.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2017,55,2,377,404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12139,,22/02/2024
127,,Introduction to the Special Issue: Urban Mobility and Crime Patterns,"This Special Issue is a collection of seven papers that seek to better our understanding of how urban mobility relates to crime patterns, and how day to day movement of people in urban spaces (urban mobility) is related to spatio-temporal patterns of crime. It focusses on urban mobility, or the dynamic movement of people in relation to crime risk. Moreover, it questions how to best measure this risk using an appropriate crime denominator. Building on the work of Sarah Boggs, this special issue contends that we need more than an appropriate denominator related to the type of crime we are measuring, for example violence based on the number of potential victims present (the exposed or ambient population), or the number of burglaries per households in an area, or the number of shoplifting offences per number of shops present. It argues that this denominator needs to be both 'crime type' appropriate, and to be spatially and temporally appropriate. When considering urban mobility as flows of people, the challenge is that the denominator can not be considered as a fixed or static concept, and that we need to consider the 'dynamic denominator' challenge. Indeed, crime hot spots which do not account for dynamic denominators may be misleading for resource prioritisation. This special issue explores a range of potential solutions to this including mobile/cell phone data, transportation data, land use data, and other possible measures to address this.",0928-1371,1572-9869,2021,27,3,307,311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10610-021-09501-7,Nov-21,22/02/2024

We use a combination of OLS regression models, harmonic analysis of diurnal patterns, and geospatial statistical techniques to examine the spatial patterning of larceny and aggravated assault in 782 Census blocks in Miami-Dade County, Florida with long-term data from 2007 to 2015. The results show that neighborhoods (i.e., Census block clusters) with higher levels of walkability have greater levels of aggravated assault. We also find that the increasing land-use diversity increases both aggravated assault and larceny. Finally, aggravated assault peaks during late night hours, while larceny peaks during daytime hours. Based on the results of our study using conventional and geospatial analyses, routine activity and social disorganization theories of neighborhood crime are partially supported, in that more motivated offenders and potential targets increase crime rates, while increased guardianship and informal social control reduce crime rates. The results of this study have important implications for security experts, law-enforcement agencies, and urban planning policy specialists focused on reducing crime in metropolitan areas. It is also relevant for theoretical frameworks designed to explain and predict temporal and spatial crime patterning.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2019,32,3,264,286,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41284-018-00161-7,,22/02/2024
129,,The Variable Impacts of Public Housing Community Proximity on Nearby Street Robberies,"Objectives: Use crime pattern theory to investigate the proximity effects of public housing communities on robbery crime while taking into account the presence of nearby nonresidential facilities. Method: The study uses data describing 41 Philadelphia public housing communities and their surrounds. Surrounds are defined using two increments of street block-sized buffers. Multilevel models (buffer areas nested around public housing communities) allowing the proximity effect to vary across communities and predicting its shape with public housing level predictors are estimated. Results: The multilevel models show that the shape of proximity effects varies across public housing communities and depends on community size, even after factoring in presence of nonresidential facilities. Spatially, multiple public housing communities close to one another have more intense robbery patterns. Conclusions: Labeling all public housing communities as equally criminogenic robbery exporters is unwarranted. In fact, some communities have lower robbery counts than the areas surrounding them. Consequently, effectively addressing robbery in and around public housing communities will require careful consideration of where the problem is located. Locating public housing communities more than two blocks apart may reduce robbery.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2013,50,2,163,188,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427811426335,,22/02/2024

Survival analysis was conducted on arrests for 1,632 parolees released from New Jersey prisons, between July 2007 and June 2009, and who spent time in Newark. The research provides some qualified support for an association between local crime hotspots and parolee recidivism, though significant associations were sparse.

131,,What Has Place Got to Do With It? Hot Spots Policing to Address Physical and Mental Health,"In the last few decades of criminological research, the contextual concept of place has become a widely discussed and studied topic. Currently, one of the most studied and discussed place-based strategies is hot spots policing, the study of crime patterns at micro-geographic places. Since the 1980s, hot spots policing has become an important and empirically validated law enforcement intervention. One of the most novel questions about hot spots policing is whether it can be used to address other issues such as the intersection of crime, place, and health. Do concentrated patterns of physical and mental health issues mirror the patterns of crime at places? If so, can hot spots policing guide police interventions? This article reviews the current state of public health and place-based crime patterns to synthesize the concept of place-based interventions for health and crime. The article concludes with implications for the scholars and practitioners.",1043-9862,1552-5406,2019,35,2,124,141,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1043986219836579,,22/02/2024

Methods: The criminal-career itinerary across Canada of 448 men convicted of sex offenses was reconstructed through individual interviews and analysis of detailed criminal records. Five distinct components of criminal nomadism (i.e., trips, nodes, paths, range, and mesolevel activity space), inspired by crime pattern theory, are suggested and analyzed. Results: Results show that criminal nomadism is the reality of young and educated Whites who have a prolific criminal career interspersed with long incarceration sentences. Nomadic offenders did not wander freely and randomly, but rather seemed to be looking for opportunities and privacy. Sex-offending variables did not make a significant contribution to predictions, suggesting that criminal nomadism is more a general offending phenomenon than something specific to sex offending. Conclusions: This study provides supporting evidence that an extensive criminal career is generally associated with a geographically scattered and nomadic lifestyle. Implications for public policies and future studies are discussed.",0047-2352,1873-6203,2022,81,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2022.101928,May-22,22/02/2024

It also created, however, a unique natural experiment. How did the pandemic affect crime levels? In this article, we analyse unique empirical data for the Netherlands, covering January 2016-March 2021, to assess if and how crime patterns changed during the first 12 months of COVID-19-related measures. Domestic violence, which was expected to rise, did not increase, nor did distraction burglary. Residential burglary, bicycle theft and pickpocketing, however, decreased considerably, especially during (some of the) weeks when lockdown measures were into force. Online crime rates on the other hand increased. An opportunity theoretical approach regarding crime offers a good explanation for these changes.",1477-3708,1741-2609,2024,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14773708241226541,Feb-24,22/02/2024
134,,Sex Offender Mobility: An Application of Crime Pattern Theory Among Child Sex Offenders,"Sex offenders are a heterogeneous group and exhibit various offense patterns. Often the location where the offender committed the offense is different from where the offender encountered their victim. Applying crime pattern theory, this study sought to understand if the type of location, victim, and situational characteristics could predict whether an offender would commit the sexual offense in a different and more secluded location than where he first encountered the victim. Among a sample of 114 incarcerated sex offenders, the results showed that offenders who contacted their victims in locations where children are known to congregate were more than 4 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location to complete the sexual offense. Those who used noncoercive strategies (e.g., bribes, seduction) during the offense process were approximately 7 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location that those who did not. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.",1079-0632,1573-286X,2018,30,8,908,931,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1079063217712219,,22/02/2024
135,,Consistency and specificity in burglars who commit prolific residential burglary: Testing the core assumptions underpinning behavioural crime linkage,"PurposeBehavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders. MethodsUsing a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences. ResultsFindings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered - some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others. ConclusionsThe findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind.",1355-3259,2044-8333,2016,21,1,77,94,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lcrp.12050,,22/02/2024
136,,The decline and locational shift of automotive theft: A local level analysis,"Purpose: Investigate the changes in the spatial patterns of auto theft in Vancouver, British Columbia during a time of a significant crime drop. Methods: Geo-referenced auto theft data, 2003 and 2013, is analyzed considering crime concentrations at the street segment level, kernel density estimation, and a nonparametric spatial point pattern test that identifies the similarity in spatial point patterns. Results: Auto theft in Vancouver has dropped significantly, but does not appear to have a stable crime pattern. Specific and limited areas account for the crime drop in auto theft rather than occurring at all places. These places appear to be related to target suitability and, therefore, opportunity. Conclusions: The crime drop for auto theft in Vancouver has occurred in particular places. This provides support for the implementation of situational prevention efforts. (C) 2016 The Authors.

137,,The search for causes in an era of crime declines: Some lessons from the study of New York City homicide,"This article addresses the problem of resting the effects of particular policies on crime rates in an era of general down trends. One illustration of that problem is our recent finding that rates of non-gun homicide had been declining substantially in New York City for 8 years prior to any significant change in policing and could not plausibly be caused by these later events. The article contrasts three different controls for time trend effects, naive cross-sectional controls, detailed models of crime causation, and qualitative checks that examine whether the details of crime patterns are changing in ways consistent with theories of policy events as change agents. The qualitative approach is embraced as a necessity.

While several researchers have noted that the police are a critical part of the community crime-control puzzle, there is very little research and no theory that addresses variation in police behavior across physical space. In an attempt to further understand police operations in local communities, this article offers a theory that explains how levels of crime and other forms of social deviance in communities affect police action.

Specifically, we analyzed residential and vehicular burglary. We used Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA) to locate and identify crime hot and cold spots over time. In order to understand the role that various sociodemographic variables play in predicting crime patterns, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to analyze the spatial clustering of crime, and commercial areas, renter percentage, median household income, and multifamily households. Our results revealed consistent hotspots for residential and vehicle burglary within the northeast area of the city, while vehicle burglary had hotspots along U.S. Route 1 (US-1)-a main road in Coral Gables-and around the University of Miami, with emerging hotspots within the northwest part of the city bordering lower-income areas. Hotspots were associated with structural factors within and around the city including more multifamily homes, higher poverty rates, more renters, and greater economic disadvantage in surrounding municipalities.

Methods: Calls for police service frequently associated with crime (theft, break and enter, domestic dispute, assault, and neighbor disputes) were acquired for a five year time span (2015-2019) for the city of North Bay, Ontario, Canada (population 50,396). Exploratory data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and a kernel density mapping technique. Andresen's spatial point pattern test (SPPT) was then used to assess the degree of similarity between the seasonal patterns (spring, summer, autumn, winter) for each call type at two different spatial scales (dissemination area and census tract). Results: Exploratory data analysis of crime concentration at street segments showed that calls are generally more dispersed through the city in the warmer seasons of spring and summer. Kernel density mapping also shows increases in the intensity of hotspots at these times, but little overall change in pattern. The SPPT does find some evidence for seasonal differences in crime pattern across the city as a whole, specifically for thefts and break and enters. These differences are focused on the downtown core, as well as the outlying rural areas of the city.

We address this question by investigating the relationship between schools and serious crime at the block group level while controlling for the potentially criminogenic effects of neighborhood instability and structural disadvantage. We find that, net of other structural correlates, neighborhoods with high schools and middle schools experience more violent, property, and narcotics crimes than those without middle or high schools. Conversely, neighborhoods with elementary schools exhibit less property crime than those not containing elementary schools.

149,,Does the Association Between Flows of People and Crime Differ Across Crime Types in Sweden?,"Places with persistently high levels of crime, hot spots, are an important object of study. To some extent, the high levels of crime at such hot spots are likely to be related to flows of people. City center locations with large flows of people are quite often also hot spots, e.g., hot spots for pick pocketing at a central train station, or hot spots for assault in the nightlife district. This can be related to crime pattern theory, or to the routine activity perspective, which both suggest that flows of people can affect crime. The present study attempts to explore and quantify whether there are differences in the association between flows of people and crime for different crime types. The analysis considers locations with high crime counts for six crime types in the city of Malmo, Sweden. For each crime type, hot spots are identified and mapped, and in order to explore whether, or how, these are related to flows of people, the crime levels are then analyzed in relation to the number of people who boarded a local bus (N = 33,134,198) nearby. The paper shows that all six crime types are associated with flows of people, although less so for arson and vandalism. This is hypothesized to be due to the relatively constant target availability for these crimes as opposed to the other crime types studied.",0928-1371,1572-9869,2021,27,3,433,449,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10610-021-09478-3,Mar-21,22/02/2024

However, numerous research studies in the area of child homicide have illustrated the importance of the power of science to correct false perceptions and misinformation, improving how to best serve and protect our children. Age-based analyses of childhood crime patterns have vastly improved how law enforcement and social service practitioners identify, investigate, and resolve child victimization cases. Future protective efforts must involve multiagency and multidisciplinary collaboration. Law enforcement, social service clinicians, educators, and academicians should jointly develop and implement pragmatic and effective prevention, detection, and resolution programs and policies.",0886-2605,1552-6518,2005,20,4,380,387,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260504269569,,22/02/2024
154,,"How Well Does Western Environmental Theory Explain Crime in the Arabian Context? The Case Study of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Crime within Arabic countries is significantly different from Western crime in type, frequency, and motivation. For example, motor vehicle theft (MVT) has constituted the largest proportion of property crime incidents in Saudi Arabia (SA) for decades. This is in stark contrast to Western countries where burglary and street theft dominate. Environmental criminology theories, such as routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, have the potential to help to investigate Arabic crime. However, there is no research that has sought to evaluate the validity of these theories within such a different cultural context. This article represents a first step in addressing this substantial research gap, taking MVT within SA as a case study. We evaluate previous MVT studies using an environmental criminology approach with a critical view to applying environmental criminology to an Arabic context. The article identifies a range of key features in SA that are different from typical Western contexts. These differences could limit the appropriateness of existing methodologies used to apply environmental criminology. The study also reveals that the methodologies associated with traditional environmental crime theory need adjusting more generally when working with MVT, not least to account for shifts in the location of opportunities for crime with time.",1057-5677,1556-3855,2019,29,1,5,32,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1057567717709497,,22/02/2024
155,,Examining the Relationship Between Road Structure and Burglary Risk Via Quantitative Network Analysis,"To test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of residential burglary is shaped by the configuration of the street network, as predicted by, for example, crime pattern theory. In particular, the study examines whether burglary risk is higher on street segments with higher usage potential. Residential burglary data for Birmingham (UK) are examined at the street segment level using a hierarchical linear model. Estimates of the usage of street segments are derived from the graph theoretical metric of betweenness, which measures how frequently segments feature in the shortest paths (those most likely to be used) through the network. Several variants of betweenness are considered. The geometry of street segments is also incorporated-via a measure of their linearity-as are several socio-demographic factors. As anticipated by theory, the measure of betweenness was found to be a highly-significant predictor of the burglary victimization count at the street segment level for all but one of the variants considered. The non-significant result was found for the most localized measure of betweenness considered. More linear streets were generally found to be at lower risk of victimization. Betweenness offers a more granular and objective means of measuring the street network than categorical classifications previously used, and its meaning links more directly to theory. The results provide support for crime pattern theory, suggesting a higher risk of burglary for streets with more potential usage. The apparent negative effect of linearity suggests the need for further research into the visual component of target choice, and the role of guardianship.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2015,31,3,481,507,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-014-9235-4,,22/02/2024
156,,The Impact of Neighborhood Context on Spatiotemporal Patterns of Burglary,"Objectives: Examine how neighborhoods vary in the degree to which they experience repeat/near repeat crime patterns and whether theoretical constructs representing neighborhood-level context, including social ecology and structural attributes, can explain variation in single incidents and those linked in space and time. Methods: Examine social, structural, and environmental design covariates from the American Community Survey to assess the context of near repeat burglary at the block group level. Spatially lagged negative binomial regression models were estimated to assess the relative contribution of these covariates on single and repeat/near repeat burglary counts. Results: Positive and consistent association between concentrated disadvantage and racial heterogeneity and all types of burglaries was evident, although the effects for other indicators, including residential instability, family disruption, and population density, varied across classifications of single and repeat/near repeat burglaries. Conclusions: Repeat/near repeat burglary patterns are conditional on the overall level and specific dimensions of disorganization, holding implications for offender-focused as well as community-focused explanations. This study contributes greater integration between the study of empirically observed patterns of repeats and community-based theories of crime, including collective efficacy.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2016,53,5,711,740,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427816647991,,22/02/2024

Longitudinal property and violent crime data were geocoded and assigned to three types of grid cells. Descriptive statistics were used to examine crime concentration, and spatial stability of crime was tested using a spatial point pattern test. The findings suggest an intense concentration of all crime types within all areal units and years of study. The higher rates of concentration were found in the analysis of less common robbery and violent crime. Findings of spatial pattern analysis suggest moderate to a high degree of similarity in spatial patterns among all crime types. However, sensitivity analysis indicates significant changes in the spatial distribution of both property and violent crime. Therefore, an alternative method is applied. Theoretical implications are discussed, highlighting routine activities and crime pattern theory.

158,,Developing patterns of violent crimes in Nigerian democratic transitions,"Nigeria embraced democracy in 1999 and adopted a tenure-based governance system that ensures transition of public leaderships every 4 years. From 1999 till date, implementation of this tenured-based leadership-change system has been shrouded in weaponized disagreements and violent crimes. Elections are the central activities in the transition procedures. Carrying out electioneering processes usually attracts over 99% of the weaponized disagreements and violent crimes, having elections conducted peacefully is equivalent to having peaceful leadership transitions in Nigeria. Following the country's deep history of ethnic division and about 33 years of military dictatorship that drowned Nigerians' fighting spirit for a better country, elections have become gun-wielding bathes and Nigerians have lost the drive to fight violence and shape their democracy for the better. This paper studies how Nigeria is fundamentally divided and how these divisions precipitate violent crime patterns in Nigerian democratic transitions. The paper also recommends a true federal system to reduce ethnic-based violence and give true independence to public institutions including the legislative and judicial arms of governments, and ensure a boarder peaceful conduct of Nigerian elections.",1359-1789,1873-6335,2020,53,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2020.101457,,22/02/2024

Hypotheses concerning journey to crime, criminal range and spatial pattern were tested. Geographical information on 76 serial offenders was extracted from police files and mapped. A series of spatial analyses were conducted in order to examine the spatial mobility of the offenders. It was found that, in line with much overseas research, offenders typically did not travel very far to offend (a median of 3 km) and operated over identifiable criminal ranges. However, in contrast to much overseas research into serial spatial patterns, New Zealand offenders were characterised by transience and commuting patterns of behaviour rather than a predominant marauder style. The implications of these findings for geographic profiling are discussed.",0004-8658,1837-9273,2006,39,2,218,231,http://dx.doi.org/10.1375/acri.39.2.218,,22/02/2024
160,,Social Context and the Static and Dynamic Age-Crime Relationship in the Republic of Korea,"The age-crime curve has been regarded as a stylized fact of the age-crime relationship. However, recent studies have found that some Asian countries have an age-crime distribution that deviates from the archetypal age-crime curve. This variation has been attributed to cultural factors associated with age effects. Using age-specific arrest data from Korea for the years 1976 through 2019, this study offers a complementary explanation of divergent age-crime patterns across countries. We make an empirical case that the observed difference between the Korean age-crime distribution and the archetypical age-crime curve in Western countries cannot be due to contextual influence on age effects alone. The age-crime relationship in Korea shows both static and dynamic characteristics. The age-period-cohort analysis of variance shows that age effects largely explain the age-crime relationship, but period and cohort effects also explain the change in the age-crime relationship over time. Moreover, the extent to which each effect manifests depends on the type of crime. Based on our findings, we propose hypotheses regarding the role of social context in shaping each effect. We suggest that cultural factors largely shaped age effects by creating age-graded changes in the social control mechanism and in routine activities. In addition, we suggest that other contextual factors, such as population dynamics, simultaneously shaped period and cohort effects by changing the level of social control, and routine activities across birth cohorts. Both cultural and historical dimensions of social context are required to understand divergent age-crime patterns across countries.",1871-0131,1871-014X,2023,18,1,21,41,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11417-022-09391-6,Nov-22,22/02/2024
161,,Perceptions of crime hot-spots and real locations of crime incidents in two South African neighbourhoods,"South Africa is characterised by high levels of crime and fear of crime that manifests in various ways at a local community level. The fear of crime is influenced by levels of social and physical disorder and the nature of the built environment, while the actual crime incidents are influenced by the land-use patterns and presence of specific built environment elements such as the railway line. This paper explores the specific crime patterns and fear of crime in two neighbourhoods, Queenswood and Kilner Park, in the north-east of the City of Tshwane. The findings show that despite relatively high numbers of crime, and contrary to the view of law enforcement agents in the area, most community members do not display high levels of fear of crime. In addition, the use and avoidance of places in the neighbourhood do not always relate to the local crime hot-spots.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2018,31,1,265,284,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41284-017-0099-9,,22/02/2024
162,,Assessing the Validity of the Law of Crime Concentration Across Different Temporal Scales,"The present study examined if Weisburd's (Criminology 53(2):133-157, 2015) law of crime concentration held across different theoretically relevant temporal scales. The cumulative percentages of Philadelphia, PA USA street blocks and intersections experiencing 25 and 50 % of street robberies by hour of the day, days of the week, and seasons of the year were compared to the bandwidth percentages established by Weisburd (2015). Different analyses were used to determine the stability of the micro-places' street robbery levels within the three temporal scales. We found that the cumulative percentages of street blocks and intersections experiencing 25 and 50 % of street robberies at each of the three temporal scales closely matched the bandwidth percentages expected from Weisburd (2015) and some micro-places experienced street robberies across all temporal periods while others had more isolated temporal concentrations. Weisburd's (2015) law of crime concentration holds across different theoretically relevant temporal scales, and future criminology of place studies should not ignore temporal crime patterns. Further, it may be possible to refine hot spots policing approaches by incorporating spatial-temporal crime concentrations.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2017,33,3,547,567,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-016-9327-4,,22/02/2024
163,,WHERE'S THE CRIME? EXPLORING DIVERGENCES BETWEEN CALL DATA AND PERCEPTIONS OF LOCAL CRIME,"Scholars typically use calls to the police to study crime patterning; however, crime reporting may be systematic across space. Using spatial video and geonarrative methodology, we investigate the overlap between perceived crime hot spots among 35 neighbourhood insiders (police officers, ex-offenders and residents) and hot spots gleaned from call data. In general, perceptual hot spots diverge from call data, but in particular, a corner store emerges as a perceptual hot spot across all groups, but not in call data. We we our data to explore the microgeographic dynamics of this hidden hot spot' We find that the corner store is relatively isolated, with few occupied residences around it and participants avoiding it. In addition, our geonarratives suggest that the store lacks adequate guardianship. We argue that mixed methodological approaches such as these are useful for understanding discrepancies between measures as well as the situational and environmental dynamics of problem places.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2020,60,2,444,467,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azz059,,22/02/2024
164,,Do offenders have distinct offending patterns before they join adult gang criminal groups? Analyses of crime specialization and escalation in offence seriousness,"Researchers have put serious efforts into identifying youth at high risk of joining gangs. Their main focus has been on street gangs, whereas risk factors for joining adult gang criminal groups have received less attention. This study examines crime specialization and crime seriousness prior to gang initiation among 564 adult gang members, 800 outlaw bikers and matched comparison groups of offenders (up to three offenders convicted of the same number of offences) who stayed out of such gangs. The data stem from Statistics Denmark and the Police Intelligence Database. The study findings demonstrate that the gang members and the outlaw bikers commit more serious offences than their non-gang counterparts, but the study also provides evidence that it is difficult - most likely impossible - to identify upcoming members of gangs by paying attention to crime patterns only.",1477-3708,1741-2609,2018,15,6,680,701,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1477370817751351,,22/02/2024
165,,Towards Forensic Whistleblowing? From Traces to Intelligence,"The role of forensic science in criminal intelligence becomes more prominent as technological innovations generate an increasing quantity of data to be detected, collected, and processed. In a societal context, where whistle-blowers prompt law-enforcement agencies to be more proactive and raise ethical issues about civil liberties, the concrete benefit provided by this global movement and its integration in policing need to be better understood. Thus, this article focuses on the use of forensic case data in criminal intelligence, especially for the detection of crime patterns. By taking into account a long-term collaboration between School of Criminal Justice and a regional crime analysis unit in Switzerland, the development of a forensic intelligence approach is studied. This approach seeks to deliver intelligence, with the means of crime data stemming from traces and explained/supported by criminological theories. This integration of forensic data in criminal intelligence is perhaps a step toward forensic whistleblowing'.",1752-4512,1752-4520,2019,13,1,80,93,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/police/pax039,,22/02/2024
166,,Getting a handle on crime: A further extension of routine activities theory,"Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. in addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness.

167,,Crime and Inflation in Cross-National Perspective,"Inflation belongs in the repertoire of economic indicators used in research on crime patterns. A resurgence of research on the relationship between economic conditions and crime has occurred in recent years, most of it showing crime increases during economic downturns and declines during recoveries. The so-called Great Recession of 2008-9 broke this pattern; crime rates fell or were flat. Historical scholarship on long-term crime increases during price revolutions and scattered empirical research on the relationship between short-run changes in crime and inflation suggest that low inflation rates help explain the absence of crime increases during the recent recession. Inflation, net of other economic conditions, had significant effects on homicide, robbery, and burglary rates in several European nations and the United States from the early 1980s to 2010. Inflation may be connected to crime through the dynamics of markets for stolen goods. As prices rise, the demand for cheap stolen goods grows, which strengthens incentives to increase the supply of stolen merchandises. Property crime rates increase. Violent crimes also increase as transactions multiply in stateless locations beyond the purview of formal authorities. The process operates in reverse as price increases diminish.",0192-3234,2153-0416,2014,43,,341,366,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/677665,,22/02/2024

The NIBRS represents an advancement over existing reporting systems and possesses considerable utility to frontline law enforcement with respect to strategic crime analysis. This paper discusses the utility of the NIBRS for identifying local and regional trends in narcotics related offenses. As an example, we selected four localities from the 1997 Virginia NIBRS data to examine trends in the sale/distribution and possession of narcotics. Our analysis shows that the NIBRS provides significantly more incident-related detail than has heretofore been available for strategic:rime analysis at the regional or state level. Moreover, the NIBRS provides neighboring communities the opportunity to compare information on emerging crime patterns and criminal enterprises which extend beyond local boundaries. Finally, enhancing local reporting compliance by highlighting the strategic utility of the data to local law enforcement will ultimately ensure the quality of the data set, which can then be employed by larger entities as well as criminal justice researchers for policy development and planning.",0748-4518,,1999,15,2,181,191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007574805500,,22/02/2024
169,,Uncovering the Spatial Patterning of Crimes: A Criminal Movement Model (CriMM),"Objectives: The main objective of this study was to see if the characteristics of offenders' crimes exhibit spatial patterning in crime neutral areas by examining the relationship between simulated travel routes of offenders along the physical road network and the actual locations of their crimes in the same geographic space. Method: This study introduced a Criminal Movement model (CriMM) that simulates travel patterns of known offenders. Using offenders' home locations, locations of major attractors (e.g., shopping centers), and variations of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm we modeled the routes that offenders are likely to take when traveling from their home to an attractor. We then compare the locations of offenders' crimes to these paths and analyze their proximity characteristics. This process was carried out using data on 7,807 property offenders from five municipalities in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) in British Columbia, Canada. Results: The results show that a great proportion of crimes tend to be located geographically proximal to the simulated travel paths with a distance decay pattern characterizing the distribution of distance measures.

Our analyses include difference in means tests, count-based regression models, and Kulldorff's scan test. We find that crime in Campinas, Brazil, exhibits both temporal and spatial-temporal patterns. However, the presence of these patterns at the different temporal scales varies by crime type.

As such, routine activity theory works well to explain temporal and spatial-temporal patterns of crime in Campinas, Brazil.

Methods: A spatial point pattern test is used to identify statistically significant change in crime patterns across Saskatoon's neighbourhoods because of COVID-19. These changes are analyzed with variables from social disorganization theory constructs using multinomial logistic regression. Results: The results indicate a city-wide decline in crime during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, at the local level, socially disorganized dissemination areas experience increases in certain crime types. Variables representing the constructs of social disorganization theory are generally able to predict these changes, suggesting the need to examine changes in crime at different geographic levels. Conclusions: COVID-19 has changed the patterns of crime in Saskatoon, but most often in theoretically expected ways.

One common response is to compromise the quality of ethnographic data. Another is to pass righteous indignation away from the poor by arguing the causal significance of deindustrialization, class inequalities, racial prejudice, policing, colonialism, or hostility toward immigrants. Almost always, such arguments are gratuitous: The evidence for the structural and historical causes offered by ethnographers does not vary with the situational and biographical variations in behavior that make for high-quality ethnographic data. Nevertheless, if we read around the rhetorical practices that contemporary ethnographers of crime use to shift shame away from their subjects and themselves, we learn how street crime is produced through small criminogenic social circles. Considered as a set, recent ethnographies have significantly advanced knowledge about the social psychology of criminality, and they provide promising leads for improving the understanding of variations in crime patterns over time and across metropolitan spaces.",2572-4568,,2019,2,,21,52,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-criminol-011518-024507,,22/02/2024

In this context, the spatial attributes of tourist cities, particularly those near heavily trafficked attractions, may be related to elevated risk for property crime and violence. This study examines crime patterns surrounding Universal Studios Florida theme park by analyzing census block data in Orlando. Various statistical techniques are utilized including geospatial mapping, local indicators of spatial association analysis (LISA), and spatial regression analysis controlling for autocorrelation between neighborhoods. Results indicate that the location of the theme park is associated with uneven crime distribution in Orlando, but those impacts are significantly influenced by the consideration of crime-generating/attracting facilities located within census blocks.",0741-8825,1745-9109,2021,38,6,1210,1229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2019.1677935,Oct-19,22/02/2024
176,,A life-course perspective on spirituality and desistance from crime,"Spirituality is a component of many drug and alcohol treatment strategies, and faith-based programming is also common within prison settings. Yet research on religiosity-crime linkages has often relied on general youth or adult samples or has included a short time line for gauging positive effects. Life-course researchers focused on serious delinquents, in turn, have often emphasized other factors associated with long-term crime patterns, such as marital attachment and job stability, or the criminality of the individual's social ties. This study draws on quantitative and qualitative data derived from a long-term follow-up of a sample of serious adolescent male and female offenders to explore the, role of spirituality and religious participation as influences on adult patterns of criminal involvement (N = 152). The respondents were first interviewed as adolescents, in 1982, and again as adults in 1995 and 2003. Results of longitudinal analyses that take into account self-report and incarceration histories at both time periods do not reveal a significant association between these indices of religiosity and the likelihood of evidencing a pattern of sustained desistance.

Using crime pattern theory as the theoretical framework, a series of preoffense factors are used to explain these differences. Methods: Two-step cluster analysis is first used to identify motive subtypes in 1009 stranger female rapes from a French police database. Kruskal-Wallis analyses then test for significant differences in distances traveled between the motivational groups. Finally, a series of negative binomial regressions are conducted to predict three distance measures: offender's residence to crime scene, victim's residence to crime scene, and victim's residence to offender's residence. Results: The average distances traveled for both offenders and victims to the crime scene, and between their residences, varied by motive. Findings from the regression models indicated that while offender motive is important, environmental characteristics and victim activity at the time of the assault also predict the distances traveled for both individuals. Conclusions: Determining the most likely motive of the offender, in conjunction with other offense characteristics that would be known at the time of investigation, has the potential to provide law enforcement officials with an indication of the unknown offender's geographic behavior in active rape cases.",0047-2352,1873-6203,2020,69,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2020.101707,,22/02/2024
179,,"Risk of Outdoor Rape and Proximity to Bus Stops, Bars, and Residences","Several researchers have linked the configuration of public places to the risk of sexual attack against women, including rape. Based on the routine activity approach and crime pattern theory, we expect to find the greatest risk of outdoor urban rape near public places that are target rich, offender rich, and guardian poor. We apply the theory to 193 outdoor rape locations in Campinas, Brazil, 2010-2013. We measure distances to the nearest bus stops, bars, and residences, then compare each of these to the distance from random points in the same city. Consistent with theory, outdoor rape victimizations occur disproportionately near bus stops and bars, but at least 250 meters away from the location of the nearest residence of any type. This baseline model suggests that urban planners could make women more secure from outdoor sexual attack by improving the design and location of public places, reducing the concealment of such places, and enhancing guardianship.",0886-6708,1945-7073,2021,36,6,723,738,http://dx.doi.org/10.1891/VV-D-20-00074,,22/02/2024

In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%. The results of this paper can provide early warnings of urban bus pickpocketing and help police reduce crimes.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2021,34,2,262,277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41284-019-00226-1,Dec-19,22/02/2024
181,,Machine learning for policing: a case study on arrests in Chile,"Police agencies expend considerable effort to anticipate future incidences of criminal behaviour. Since a large proportion of crimes are committed by a small group of individuals, preventive measures are often targeted on prolific offenders. There is a long-standing expectation that new technologies can improve the accurate identification of crime patterns. Here, we explore big data technology and design a machine learning algorithm for forecasting repeated arrests. The forecasts are based on administrative data provided by the national Chilean police agencies, including a history of arrests in Santiago de Chile and personal metadata such as gender and age. Excellent algorithmic performance was achieved with various supervised machine learning techniques. Still, there are many challenges regarding the design of the mathematical model, and its eventual incorporation into predictive policing will depend upon better insights into the effectiveness and ethics of preemptive strategies.",1043-9463,1477-2728,2021,31,9,1036,1050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10439463.2020.1779270,Jun-20,22/02/2024
182,,IMPLICATIONS OF CROSS-BORDER CRIME RISKS IN AN OPEN EUROPE,"It is to be expected that the development of an open economic space within the E.C. and the increased accessibility of Eastern Europe will lead to new patterns of cross-border crimes. So do the risks of becoming a victim of one of those crimes. However, the risks may not be spread evenly: some markets may become more affected by crime-entrepreneurs than other markets, though most attention is devoted to drug trafficking and drug money related money-laundering. However, organized drug trafficking and organized fraud are not so neetly seperated. From crime-entrepreneurial point of view one can broadly speak of cross-border crime markets in European regions. The criminological implications may be the development of Euro-crime markets in which crime-entrepreneurs develop lasting patterns of cooperation and cross-border organizations. This is already the case on the illicit drug market. Crime patterns on the field of organized commercial crime, toxic waste trafficking or EC-fraud point in the same direction. The implications for business and law enforcement alike are that without the development of new strategies of prevention and cross-border police investigations organized crime may well intertwine into the developing European economic and social structure thus acquiring a corrosive foothold in the legitimate industry.",0925-4994,,1993,20,2,99,111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01418436,,22/02/2024
183,,When the West Meets the East: Cultural Clash and Its Impacts on Anomie in a Sample of Chinese Adolescents,"Criminological studies conducted in China have highlighted the important role of Chinese culture and anomie theory in explaining crime patterns and delinquency among adolescents. None of the studies, however, have empirically tested the relationship between cultural attachment and anomie. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of ethnic identity associated with cultural attachment on anomie in the Chinese social setting. Specifically, the effects of both attachment to conventional Chinese culture and attachment to Western popular culture (WPC) were examined; the interaction between the two may shed some important light on how culture and cultural conflict can lead to anomie among Chinese adolescents. The data analyzed were collected from a sample of more than 6,500 middle school students. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. The study found that attachment to traditional Chinese cultural values, especially showing respect to conventional figures/values, reduces anomie among adolescents. In contrast, attraction to WPC and being socially labeled as a big fan of WPC elevate the levels of anomie reported by the students. Reflections on cultural conflict and relevant policy implications are provided in the Discussions and conclusions section.",0163-9625,1521-0456,2019,40,10,1187,1205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2018.1472934,,22/02/2024

Despite these findings, there has been little criticism of the methodological approaches employed by the key research and the lack of attention paid to understanding and explaining the crime patterns that emerge from these surveys. This paper reviews the key previous research that has been conducted and begins to consider a number of questions about the future directions for research in this area. First the key research is considered and what this tells us about the nature and extent of victimization against businesses.

To understand how crime patterns are generated, situation al crime prevention must also consider offender resources and their distribution and social-technical change.

187,,Crime-general and crime-specific spatial patterns: A multivariate spatial analysis of four crime types at the small-area scale,"Purpose: To examine if, and how, spatial crime patterns are explained by one or more underlying crime-general patterns. Methods: A set of Bayesian multivariate spatial models are applied to analyze burglary, robbery, vehicle crime, and violent crime at the small-area scale. The residual variability of each crime type is partitioned into shared and type-specific components after controlling for the effects of population density, deprivation, residential instability, and ethnic heterogeneity. Shared components account for the correlations between crime types and identify the crime-general patterns shared amongst multiple crimes. Results: Two shared components are estimated to capture the crime-general pattern for all four crime types and the crime-general pattern for theft-related crimes (burglary, robbery, and vehicle crime). Robbery and violent crime exhibit the strongest positive associations with deprivation, instability, and ethnic heterogeneity. Shared components explain the largest proportions of variability for all crime types. Burglary, robbery, and vehicle crime each exhibit type-specific patterns that diverge from the crime-general patterns. Conclusions: Crime-general patterns are important for understanding the spatial patterning of many crime types at the small-area scale. Multivariate spatial models provide a framework to directly quantify the correlation structures between crimes and reveal the underlying crime-general patterns shared amongst multiple crime types.",0047-2352,1873-6203,2018,58,,22,32,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2018.06.003,,22/02/2024

Despite widespread global adoption, empirical evaluation of the impact of COMPSTAT lags behind popular accounts of its crime control benefits. Purpose: This article evaluates the crime control impact of Queensland Police Service's version of COMPSTAT known as Operational Performance Reviews (OPRs). Method: A mixed model analytic approach was used to assess the role of OPRs in explaining spatial and temporal variations in crime patterns across Queensland's 29 police districts. Results: Analysis of the impact of OPRs on reported crime (specifically assaults, robberies and unlawful entries) suggests major differences between police districts, and that some districts are driving overall statewide crime reductions, whilst others confound positive effects of implementation of OPRs in Queensland. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the crime drop experienced throughout Queensland found in prior research (Mazerolle et al., 2007) is most likely attributable to a small number of police districts. The implication of these findings is that a number of districts could (and should) be called-upon during maturation of Queensland's OPRs to reduce specific crime problems in their districts and facilitate ongoing crime reductions across the state.

A comparison of asylum migrants with different legal statuses,"Contrary to natural born citizens, migrants can have a variety of legal statuses depending on how they are classified by immigration law. Together, such legal or 'civic' statuses constitute a system of civic stratification, from high (privileged) to low (restricted). Recent scholarship highlights the relevance of immigration law for understanding crime patterns. We analytically synthesize this literature and extend it empirically by examining its usefulness in explaining the relationship between asylum migrants' civic statuses in The Netherlands and their chances of being registered as a crime suspect. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using a unique dataset in which comprehensive administrative data from various governmental sources were combined. Four civic status groups were compared: naturalized citizens, residence permit holders, asylum seekers in the procedure, and former asylum seekers whose stay in the country had become unauthorized. The results suggest that strain theory and more constructionist stances are required in order to understand the complex relationship between civic stratification and crime.

This study examines temporal patterns between months to explore the impact of the modifiable temporal unit problem (MTUP). We analyzed 26,555 violent crime incidents reported to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department from a 60-month observation period and geocoded these incidents to 14,106 street segments.

191,,"Analysis of the risk of theft from vehicle crime in Kyoto, Japan using environmental indicators of streetscapes","With the advent of spatial analysis, the importance of analyzing crime patterns based on location has become more apparent. Previous studies have advanced our understanding of the factors associated with crime concentration in street networks. However, it has recently become possible to assess the factors associated with crime at even finer spatial scales of streetscapes, such as the existence of greenery or walls, owing to the availability of streetscape image data and progress in machine learning-based image analysis. Such place-scale environments can be both crime-producing and crime-preventing, depending on the composition of the streetscape environment. In this study, we attempted to assess the risk of crime occurrence through place-scale indicators using streetscape images and their interaction terms through binomial logistic regression modeling of the place-scale crime risk of theft from vehicles in the central part of Kyoto City, Japan. The results suggest that the effects of specific streetscape components on the risk of crime occurrence are certainly dependent on other components. For example, the association of the crime occurrence risk with the occupancy rate of vegetation in a streetscape image is positive when there are few buildings and walls, and vice versa. The findings of this study show the importance of considering the complex composition of visible streetscape components in assessing the place-scale risk of crime occurrence.",,2193-7680,2022,11,1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40163-022-00175-y,,22/02/2024

These changes are analysed with variables from social disorganization theory constructs using ANOVA. Results At the neighbourhood level, all crime types have significant change during COVID, but not always at the city level. Different neighbourhoods have different changes in crime despite these changes appearing to be constant at the city level; local effects asre important to consider. Variables representing the constructs of social disorganization theory are able to predict these changes.

Methods: Geocoded arrests for drug buyers in an urban municipality, over a three year period, spatially identify major drug markets. Negative binomial regression is used to model compositional characteristics of drug arrestees and contextual effects of markets on distance to arrest (n=4,082). Results: Trip distance to drug purchase arrest varies by drug market. Being white, and having prior contact with the criminal justice system correlated with longer trip distances. Additional compositional effects vary by drug type. Conclusions: In line with prior journey to crime research and crime pattern theory, illicit drug buyers are arrested in close proximity of their homes.

194,,Measuring the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Police Proactivity,"To measure where officers engage in proactive, self-initiated activities, how much time they spend being proactive, and whether their proactive activities coincide with crime patterns. This study uses Andresen's Spatial Point Pattern Test to compare the spatial similarity between police proactivity and crime, as well as regression modeling to explore the relationship between proactivity and crime and the time spent on proactivity and crime. In the jurisdiction examined, high levels of proactivity are noted. This proactive activity is more likely to occur in places where crime is most concentrated. Additionally, the number of proactive calls and the proactive time spent per crime-and-disorder call remain high and stable across spatial scales. For each crime call received at a street block, police initiated 0.7 proactive activities and spent approximately 28 min carrying out proactive works. This study develops a way of measuring proactive activity by patrol officers using calls for service data. We find that not only do officers in this jurisdiction exhibit higher levels of proactivity to prevent crime (compared to reacting to crime), but they also do so in targeted, micro-place ways. Agencies may consider using similar techniques to gauge the levels of proactivity in their agencies if proactive activity is a goal.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2017,33,4,915,934,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-016-9318-5,,22/02/2024

For this reason, it is important to establish the driving factors of criminality on a jurisprudential and criminal level. In Colombia, consolidating this measurement poses various challenges. However, homicide remains one of the most representative crimes, not only because of the veracity of the statistical data it generates, but because cognitive, social and economic conditions associated with the victim or aggressor are circumscribed within the action's execution (Brookman, 2005). The methodology is focused on explaining, interpreting and applying the concepts developed in the threshold analysis using data from SIEDCO2. In this study's case, common homicides recorded in 2019 in the city of Bogota were correlated with this city's behavior in the last five years by localities, as well as by political departments and municipalities on a national level. Using the above, another information analysis tool that allows interpreting from an objective perspective will be made known. As a result, it was established that the threshold analysis allows combining historical data, averages and standard deviations to methodologically determine and guide timely decision-making, recognizing crime pattern detection (positive and negative) on different levels of geographic disaggregation (regions, departments, municipalities, localities, communes, neighborhoods, etc.), contributing to developing public policies in terms of coexistence and security, and planning and distributing interinstitutional efforts against the conducts that affect the community.",1794-3108,2256-5531,2020,62,2,9,31,,,22/02/2024

There are indications that minority offenders who commit less serious or nonserious offenses seem to be punished more harshly than similar Dutch offenders. Relatively more ethnic minority members are placed in pretrial detention and sentenced to prison-partly because of different crime patterns, partly because many have no fixed residence, and partly because many are less likely than Dutch defendants to turn up at the trial and to plead guilty. Even taking account of these variables, minority membership continues to be a factor in explaining sentencing.

We propose exploiting social media (Twitter) data to construct estimates of the population at various locations at different times of day, and assess whether these estimates help predict the amount of crime during two-hour time periods over the course of the day. We address these questions using crime data for 97,428 blocks in the Southern California region, along with geocoded information on tweets in the region over an eight month period. The results show that this measure of the temporal ambient population helps explain the level of crime in blocks during particular time periods.

Furthermore, the offending level of gang members is higher when they report being active members of the gang. Therefore, gang membership clearly facilitates offending above and beyond individual level characteristics. But what impact does the onset of gangs have on aggregate crime patterns? By exploring levels and patterns of crime in an emergent gang city (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), the authors test whether the individual level finding linking gang membership to increased offending equates to more crime at the aggregate, citywide level. They also explore the impact that gang formation has on local patterns of crime. Gangs tend to be territorial, but although many qualitative accounts describe the crime-gang relationship within the community, few empirical studies have explored how gangs shape the spatial distribution of crime in and around their territory.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2007,44,2,208,237,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427806298356,,22/02/2024

We estimate the effect of transit on crime using a stepped-wedge design estimated with Poisson regression with permutation tests to assess statistical significance. Two labor strikes during the study period created a natural experiment for which we assessed the short-term effect of transit on crime. We find no evidence that transit station openings or disruptions in transit due to strikes result in changes in crime in surrounding neighborhoods. The results suggest that rail transit may produce no major consequence for overall neighborhood crime patterns.

We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve.

As a result, it was established that the threshold analysis allows combining historical data, averages and standard deviations to methodologically determine and guide timely decision-making, recognizing crime pattern detection (positive and negative) on different levels of geographic disaggregation (regions, departments, municipalities, localities, communes, neighborhoods, etc.), contributing to developing public policies in terms of coexistence and security, and planning and distributing interinstitutional efforts against the conducts that affect the community.",1794-3108,2256-5531,2020,62,2,33,54,,,22/02/2024
205,,Property crime on college campuses: A case study using GIS and related tools,"Crime on college campuses. appears related to the Physical characteristics and routines of the people occupying that space. Environmental criminology suggests that nodes locations to and from which people routinely travel help explain the distribution of crime in a given space. The current study examined the role of nodes in explaining the distribution of property crime on a college campus using 24 months of police incident data. More specifically, using GIS and related tools, we compared the distribution of property crime occurring at locations in a major medical center on the campus with locations in the non-medical side. Results revealed more property crime occurred on the medical side of campus and that differences existed in crime patterns for the two nodes based on time, location and season. We conclude by discussing the utility of GIS in allocating resources and crime prevention strategies for college campuses.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2014,27,3,263,283,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/sj.2012.24,,22/02/2024
206,,Do Schools Cause Crime in Neighborhoods? Evidence from the Opening of Schools in Philadelphia,"Objectives To assess the impact of schools on crime in neighborhoods. Methods We utilize data of charter and public schools in Philadelphia to estimate the effect of school openings on neighborhood crime patterns between 1998 and 2010. We estimate the change in crime in areas surrounding schools before and after their opening compared to areas where schools were always open with Poisson regression models. We also estimate changes in crime in census tracts as schools are added compared to census tracts that never had schools. Finally, we compare estimates from Poisson regression models to those derived from permutation tests where schools are randomly assigned different opening dates. Results We find no evidence that school openings increase crime relative to locations where schools were always open or never had schools. The models generally produce null effects, though there is some evidence for a reduction in property crimes for public school openings and a reduction in violent crimes for charter school openings within certain distances. Estimates at the census tract level show that changes in the number of schools are not associated with any changes in crime relative to tracts with no schools. Conclusions Contrary to a large theoretical and empirical literature, the results suggest that school locations play a minimal role in neighborhood crime production in Philadelphia. Future research should investigate specific contexts and mechanisms, such as land-use characteristics and travel patterns to schools, which may interact with specific school settings in ways that are related to crime production.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2018,34,3,717,740,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-017-9352-y,,22/02/2024
207,,Quantifying the Exposure of Street Segments to Drinking Places Nearby,"Introduce and test the relative efficacy of two methods for modeling the impact of cumulative 'exposure' to drinking facilities on violent crime at street segments. One method, simple count, sums the number of drinking places within a distance threshold. The other method, inverse distance weighted count, weights each drinking place within a threshold based on its distance from the street segment. Closer places are weighted higher than more distant places. Distance is measured as the street length from a street segment to a drinking place along the street network. Seven distance thresholds of 400, 800, 1,200, 1,600, 2,000, 2,400 and 2,800 feet are tested. A negative binomial regression model controlling for socio-economic characteristics, opportunity factors and spatial autocorrelation is used to evaluate which of the measure/threshold combinations produce a better fit as compared to a model with no exposure measures. Exposure measured as an inverse distance weighted count produces the best fitting model and is significantly related to violent crime at longer distances than simple count (from 400 to 2,800 feet). Exposure to drinking places using a simple count is significantly related to violent crime up to 2,000 feet. Both models indicate the influence of drinking places is highest at shorter distance thresholds. Both researchers and practitioners can more precisely quantify the influence of drinking places in multivariate models of street segment level violent crime by incorporating proximity in the development of a cumulative exposure measure. The efficacy of using exposure measures to quantify the influence of other types of facilities on crime patterns across street segments should be explored.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2014,30,3,527,548,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-013-9213-2,,22/02/2024
208,,Crime Seasonality: Examining the Temporal Fluctuations of Property Crime in Cities With Varying Climates,"This study investigates whether crime patterns fluctuate periodically throughout the year using data containing different property crime types in two Canadian cities with differing climates. Using police report data, a series of ordinary least squares (OLS; Vancouver, British Columbia) and negative binomial (Ottawa, Ontario) regressions were employed to examine the corresponding temporal patterns of property crime in Vancouver (2003-2013) and Ottawa (2006-2008). Moreover, both aggregate and disaggregate models were run to examine whether different weather and temporal variables had a distinctive impact on particular offences. Overall, results suggest that cities that experience greater variations in weather throughout the year have more distinct increases of property offences in the summer months and that different climate variables affect certain crime types, thus advocating for disaggregate analysis in the future.",0306-624X,1552-6933,2017,61,16,1866,1891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624X16632259,,22/02/2024
209,,Crime and COVID-19: effect of changes in routine activities in Mexico City,"Background: This study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of routine activities, as measured by changes in public transport passenger numbers. Method: The first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors. Results: Results indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that some of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the findings suggested that the changes in mobility explain part of the declines observed, with important variations per crime type. Conclusion: The findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explicitly test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities.",,2193-7680,2021,10,1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40163-021-00151-y,,22/02/2024
210,,When Crime Moves Where Does It Go? Analyzing the Spatial Correlates of Robbery Incidents Displaced by a Place-based Policing Intervention,"Objective: Examine the place-based correlates of robbery activity displaced by a foot-patrol intervention in Newark, NJ. We use constructs from Crime Pattern and Social Disorganization theories to test hypotheses concerned with associations between the structure of the environment and the displacement of crime. Method: Robbery incidents were spatially joined to street segments to study micro-level displacement processes. Predictor variables were operationalized using data from the Newark Police Department and Infogroup USA. Generalized Linear models tested associations between the characteristics of street segments and displaced robbery in the target area as compared to a control. Results: Environmental structure is important to understanding the settings of displacement, though this varied between spatial and temporal displacement. Relationships between displaced crime activity and model covariates did not always appear in expected directions. For example, bus stops predicted increased spatial displacement while corner stores predicted decreased levels of temporal displacement. Conclusions: While testing for displacement has become commonplace in place-based policing interventions, less attention has been paid to the micro-level factors that may facilitate the displacement of crime events. Both bus stops and corner stores show consistent associations with displaced crime activity, but the directions of these relationships suggest more complex processes requiring further examination.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2022,59,1,128,162,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00224278211016030,May-21,22/02/2024
211,,Spatial Distribution of Crime in Bangladesh: An Analysis,"Crime mapping has become popular as a way of analysing the spatial distribution of crime, and its use enables effective crime prevention strategies to be employed based on the analysis of hotspots. However, in Bangladesh crime mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS) is still in its infancy. This paper intends to focus on the spatial distribution of crime throughout the major administrative divisions of Bangladesh and to explore how it varies according to region. Its objective is to fill the existing knowledge gap in terms of the spatial distribution of crime in Bangladesh with the help of GIS software. All associated issues behind any crime patterns in different regions have been analysed here using references from established research. This study also illustrates the trend analysis of crime in the last three years, from 2016 to 2018, to understand the patterns of crime distribution as per present administrative divisions. It also focuses on the relative frequency of incidents of crime in all the regions of Bangladesh. Additionally, this study indicates that areas with big cities (Dhaka and Chattogram) are more prone to harbouring a greater number of offenders than other areas. As an initial study using GIS-based computerised crime mapping in Bangladesh, this research may have an important role in showing division wise crime distribution.",2148-6646,2602-3911,2021,9,2,479,503,http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/JPLC2021-931625,,22/02/2024

While several studies have explored the impact of the pandemic on crime patterns and certain workforce aspects such as leadership and stress, the current study attempts to fill a gap in the literature by quantifiably estimating the impact of the COVID-19 on sickness, absence, and mortality in the police workforce. It finds that while absence rates were higher than normal, this was primarily associated with self-isolation policies. While the incidence of COVID-19 in police officers may have been higher than the incidence in the general public, the mortality rate actually reflected a reduction on the pre-pandemic year.

213,,Hot spots policing in a high-crime environment: an experimental evaluation in Medellin,"Objectives Test direct, spillover, and aggregate effects of hot spots policing on crime in a high-crime environment. Methods We identified 967 hot spot street segments and randomly assigned 384 to a six-month increase in police patrols. To account for the complications resulting from a large experimental sample in a dense network of streets, we use randomization inference for hypothesis testing. We also use non-experimental streets to test for spillovers onto non-hot spots and examine aggregate effects citywide. Results Our results show an improvement in short-term security perceptions and a reduction in car thefts, but no direct effects on other crimes or satisfaction with policing services. We see larger effects in the least secure places, especially for short-term security perceptions, car thefts, and assaults. We find no evidence of crime displacement but rather a decrease in car thefts in nearby hot spots and a decrease in assaults in nearby non-hot spots. We estimate that car thefts decreased citywide by about 11%. Conclusions Our study highlights the importance of context when implementing hot spots policing. What seems to work in the USA or even in Bogota is not as responsive in Medellin (and vice versa). Further research-especially outside the USA-is needed to understand the role of local crime patterns and police capacity on the effectiveness of hot spots policing.",1573-3750,1572-8315,2021,17,3,473,506,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11292-019-09390-1,Feb-20,22/02/2024
214,,Cannabis in the capital: exploring the spatial association between medical marijuana dispensaries and crime,"The legalization of medical marijuana remains a controversial policy. An important dimension of marijuana legalization is the siting of dispensaries and their influence on a surrounding community. Specifically, dispensaries, if they engender criminogenic opportunities via changes in routine activities, have the potential to increase crimes in the areas surrounding medicinal marijuana dispensaries (MMDs). Using a quasi-experimental design, we examine the relationship between MMDs and crime using micro-spatial units in a novel location. Street level geocoded crime data for violent and nonviolent crime patterns before and after the opening of MMD's in Washington, D.C. Crime is analyzed with 100 m buffers around each dispensary and control location drawn from propensity score matching. Differences between crime rates pre- and postoperation are compared. With the exception of one location, crime decreased or remained constant in geographical areas following the opening of a dispensary. MMDs do not appear to have an immediate criminogenic effect. Implications for future research regarding potential confounding factors and data limitations are discussed.",0735-648X,2158-9119,2020,43,1,1,15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.2019.1582351,,22/02/2024
215,,Exploring 'near': Characterizing the spatial extent of drinking place influence on crime,"The important role of facilities in understanding crime patterns is widely recognized. Studies have demonstrated a connection between the presence of facilities such as bars, parks, schools and fast food restaurants and higher crime rates. Typically, these studies use a single distance threshold. Areas within the threshold are assumed to be related to the facility and those outside the threshold unrelated. But the choice of threshold in each study is usually an ad hoc decision based on the expertise of the researcher. Until recently, there has been no systematic evaluation of the methodology used to define those thresholds. This paper evaluates two methods for determining an empirically-based answer to the question 'How close is near?' The results of an example analysis testing the association of drinking places and crime in Seattle, Washington are reported. The two most common facility-based measures, Euclidean distance buffers and Street distance buffers are compared across two levels of aggregation and 18 separate distances. Findings indicate the geographic extent of increased crime around drinking places varies based on the type of buffer (Euclidean vs. Street distance) and the width of the distance bands (street block vs. 402 meter (quarter mile) increments). The geographic extent of the influence of drinking places on crime is best captured by street distance measures across street block distances (122 meter bands). Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed.",0004-8658,1837-9273,2011,44,2,156,179,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0004865811405253,,22/02/2024
216,,A Network Approach to Examine Neighborhood Interdependence Through the Target Selection of Repeat Buyers of Commercial Sex in the United States,"The geographic concentration and diffusion of crime and deviancy are longstanding criminological inquiries, yet few studies have examined how certain illicit behaviors transcend neighborhood borders and connect neighborhoods in patterns of crime and deviancy. A structural neighborhood interdependence may account for the enduring nature and spread of crime, making it critical to understand how neighborhoods are connected in crime patterns to guide crime prevention and disruption efforts. This study examines neighborhood interdependence through the case of repeat buyers of commercial sex in illicit massage businesses in a metropolitan city in the United States. By frequenting venues for illicit commercial sex in multiple neighborhoods, buyers create inter-neighborhood connections through which the demand for an illicit market can spread across neighborhoods. Using online review data about buyers of commercial sex, this study analyzes this neighborhood interdependence as a network comprised of nodes (neighborhoods) and edges (connections between neighborhoods). Exponential random graph models were used to analyze how characteristics of neighborhoods, the space between neighborhoods, and the overall network of neighborhoods explain inter-neighborhood connectivity in an illicit market for commercial sex. The implications for research, policy, and practice will be discussed.",0163-9625,1521-0456,2023,44,6,876,899,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2022.2110542,Aug-22,22/02/2024

The Geographic Profiling Suspect Mapping And Ranking Technique (GP-SMART) maps suspects' activity locations available in police records-such as home addresses, family members' home addresses, prior offence locations, locations of non-crime incidents, and other contacts with police-and ranks suspects based on both the proximity and nature of these locations, relative to an input crime. In accuracy tests using solved burglary, robbery and extra-familial sex offence cases in New Zealand (n = 4511), GP-SMART ranked the offender at or near the top of the suspect list at rates greatly exceeding chance.

218,,Community-level impacts of temperature on urban street robbery,"Purpose: Conduct the first empirical intra-urban examination of community-level connections between street robbery and temperature. Examine whether community socioeconomic status (SES) and crime-relevant land uses strengthen or weaken the temperature impact. A theoretical framework relying on routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, and resident-based control dynamics organized predictions. Data and methods: For Philadelphia census tracts (n = 381), monthly street robbery counts and temperature data for 36 consecutive months were combined with census and land use data, and analyzed with multilevel models. Results: Community robbery counts were higher when temperatures were higher, and in lower SES communities. In support of previous work with property crime, but in contrast to previous work with assault, the effects of temperature were stronger in higher SES communities. In support of the integrated model, commercial land use prevalence and subway stations were associated with heightened temperature impacts on robbery. Conclusions: Community-level fixed and random effects of temperature on urban robbery counts persist when controlling for land use and community structure; further, the random effects depend in part on both. There are implications for understanding indigenous guardianship or informal resident-based place management dynamics, and for planning seasonal police deployments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

219,,New York City: COVID-19 quarantine and crime,"Purpose In early 2020, the world faced a rapid life-changing pandemic in the form of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. Citywide lockdowns with stay-at-home orders and mass closings quickly became the new normal. With these new mandates, routine activity, mental health and financial securities all began to experience major deviations, and it became clear that this could prove to be rather valuable in providing the opportunity for large-scale criminology experiments. This study aims to explore New York City's (NYC) crime patterns during this unique social situation. Specifically, has crime as a whole increased or decreased, and have particular crimes increased or decreased during these stressful fluid times? Design/methodology/approach The authors briefly review previous crises and worldwide trends but focus on NYC crime as collected by the New York Police Department's statistics unit, CompStat. An analysis of 13 crime types from March 30 to July 5 was completed, including percent differences and individual weekly incidence rates in citywide crimes compared to the same time in 2019. Findings The analysis demonstrated that all crimes analyzed, except for murder and burglary, exhibited a statistically significant difference during COVID-19 conditions compared to the same time the previous year. Grand larceny auto and gun violence crimes significantly increased during COVID-19 weeks, whereas rape, other sex crimes, robbery, felony assault, grand larceny, transit, housing, misdemeanor assault and petit larceny all significantly decreased. Originality/value Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, this is amongst the first studies to examine trends in NYC crime during pandemic mandates. Expanding our knowledge in these situations can inform natural disaster responses, as well as criminal justice policy and practice to better protect the public in future crises.",2009-3829,,2021,11,3,203,221,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JCP-10-2020-0046,May-21,22/02/2024
220,,Gender Variation in the Age-Crime Relation in Cross-National Context: Taiwan-US Comparison,"Purpose Hirschi and Gottfredson's premise of a ubiquitous adolescent-driven age-crime relation is widely endorsed, yet empirical tests have relied almost solely on non-disaggregated western data reflecting male patterns. Joint effects of gender and age have been strongly assumed but not broadly tested. To examine the invariance thesis, we probed for conditioning effects of gender and social context by comparing gender-age-crime patterns in an East Asian society, Taiwan, with those in the USA. Methods Unique disaggregated arrest data for Taiwan and the USA were leveraged to determine whether there were within- as well as between-country differences in the age-gender-crime relation and whether the age-gender distributions were invariant across social groups and cultures. Results Major findings were as follows: (1) striking within-country similarity in age distributions of male and female offenders; and (2) considerable between-country dissimilarity in age-crime schedules of males and females: Taiwan male and female age-crime curves were less peaked and older than the US male and female age-crime curves, diverging from the widely-held premise of a ubiquitous adolescent-spiked age-crime curve. Conclusion Strong cross-national variation in the age-crime relation, paired with remarkable gender similarity within nations, support life course approaches attentive to social context and suggest considerable mutability of any biological processes shaping the age-crime, the gender-crime, and the gender-age-crime relation.",2199-4641,2199-465X,2021,7,4,623,648,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40865-021-00176-6,Sep-21,22/02/2024
221,,Patterns of juvenile offending in Shanghai and Brisbane,"This paper reports an analysis of participation rates and types of delinquent behaviour using self-reported offending data from school students and apprehended juvenile offenders in Brisbane (n = 903) and in Shanghai (n = 565).The rate of participation in most categories of offending in the Brisbane sample was higher than in the Shanghai sample, with Brisbane school students being much more likely than Shanghai students to report at least one type of offence (85.8% vs. 28.8%). However, factor analyses revealed a common crime pattern across both samples, with behaviours grouping into theft, property-related offences, fighting, and disturbing public order. Brisbane school respondents were more likely than their Shanghai counterparts to commit multiple types of offences. Co-offending peaked at ages 15-16 in Brisbane and 17-18 in Shanghai, but was more common in the Shanghai sample than in the Brisbane sample. It is argued that compared with Australian young people there is a greater presence of social institutions in the lives of Chinese adolescents in the form of family, community and state controls, and that these mostly informal control systems appear to have been successful so far in containing the criminogenic impacts of rapid social change.",0004-8658,1837-9273,2004,37,,32,51,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00048658040370S103,,22/02/2024
222,,When Do Offenders Commit Crime? An Analysis of Temporal Consistency in Individual Offending Patterns,"Objectives Building on Hagerstrand's time geography, we expect temporal consistency in individual offending behavior. We hypothesize that repeat offenders commit offenses at similar times of day and week. In addition, we expect stronger temporal consistency for crimes of the same type and for crimes committed within a shorter time span. Method We use police-recorded crime data on 28,274 repeat offenders who committed 152,180 offenses between 1996 and 2009 in the greater The Hague area in the Netherlands. We use a Monte Carlo permutation procedure to compare the overall level of temporal consistency observed in the data to the temporal consistency that is to be expected given the overall temporal distribution of crime. Results Repeat offenders show strong temporal consistency: they commit their crimes at more similar hours of day and week than expected. Moreover, the observed temporal consistency patterns are indeed stronger for offenses of the same type of crime and when less time has elapsed between the offenses, especially for offenses committed within a month after the prior offense. Discussion The results are consistent with offenders having recurring rhythms that shape their temporal crime pattern. These findings might prove valuable for improving predictive policing methods and crime linkage analysis as well as interventions to reduce recidivism.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2021,37,4,863,889,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-020-09470-w,Aug-20,22/02/2024
223,,"Investigating honour-based abuse and other crimes in South Asian communities: the benefits, limitations and impacts of 'ethnic matching' and ethnic 'difference' of police officers","This article considers the benefits, limitations and potential impacts of 'ethic matching' South Asian (SA) police officers to victims, or conversely allocating 'different' non-SA officers to reported honour-based abuse (HBA) cases and other crimes. To explore these themes, semi-structured interviews in one English police force with 15 police specialist detectives in Public Protection took place. Lack of cultural competence by some non-SA officers was evident, exposing stereotyping and tokenism. Some professional race anxiety features, but to a lesser extent. Cultural ignorance impacts an officer's ability to identify crime patterns; results in misconstruing victim perspectives and means that officers may not recognise cues that victims are at risk. The opposing perspective identifies that there are enormous benefits to 'ethnic matching' SA officers and victims when investigating crimes, notably enhanced insight due to cultural competence, excellent victim rapport and the use of foreign language skills. Conversely, findings indicate that in exceptional circumstances cultural bias by some same ethnicity officers can act as an impediment, influencing officer decision-making and detrimentally affecting victims' best interests. Extant literature reinforces the contention that victims do not want to be 'ethnic matched' to the police or other professionals, for fear that officials may leak information to the wider community. Albeit there are notable benefits to ethnic matching, factors such as training and experience are equally important. Nevertheless, the article affords valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of ethnic matching and ethnic difference, which will aid operational supervisory police officers when resourcing such incidents.",1043-9463,1477-2728,2022,32,9,1049,1070,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10439463.2021.2010733,Dec-21,22/02/2024
224,,State of the Art in Agent-Based Modeling of Urban Crime: An Overview,"ObjectivesAgent-based modeling (ABM) is a type of computer simulation that creates a virtual society and allows controlled experimentation. ABM has the potential to be a powerful tool for exploring criminological theory and testing the plausibility of crime prevention interventions when data are unavailable, when they would be unethical to collect, or when policy-makers need an answer quickly. This paper takes stock of the current literature to discuss the potential contributions of ABM, assess current practice, identify shortcomings that threaten the validity of findings using ABM, and to make suggestions regarding the construction and communication of future work using ABM.MethodsWe systematically searched major databases to find all publications using ABM to simulate urban crime patterns and coded publications to quantify the following information: (1) characteristics of the publication, the model and the agents, (2) model purpose, (3) crime type investigated, and (4) interrogation of the model via sensitivity testing and validation.ResultsAfter sifting papers according to our inclusion criteria, we identified and reviewed 45 publications. Models informed by the opportunity theory framework dominated. Most publications lacked detail sufficient to enable replication. Many did not include clear a rationale for modeling choices, parameter selection or calibration. Rarely were parameters calibrated using empirical data. Model validation was limited and inconsistent across papers.ConclusionsABM offers significant potential for criminological enquiry. However, at present, the lack of model detail reported in publications makes it difficult to assess where sufficient evidence exists to supportand where gaps limitthe development of models that reflect extant conditions and offender decision-making. For the field to progress, as a minimum, standardized reporting that encourages transparency will be necessary.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2019,35,1,155,193,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-018-9376-y,,22/02/2024
225,,"Predictive policing: not yet, but soon preemptive?","For several years now, crime prediction software operating on the basis of data analysis and algorithmic pattern detection has been employed by police departments throughout the world. As these technologies aim at forestalling criminal events, they may aptly be understood as elements of preventive strategies. Do they also initiate a logic of preemptive policing, as several authors have suggested? Using the example of crime prediction software that is used in German-speaking countries, the article shows how current forms of predictive policing echo classical modes of risk calculation: usually employed in connection with domestic burglary, they help police to identify potential high-risk areas by extrapolating past crime patterns into the future. However, preemptive elements also emerge, to the extent that the software fosters 'possibilistic' thinking in police operations. Moreover, current advances in crime prediction technologies give us a quite different picture of a probable future of preemptive policing. Following a general trend of data-driven government that draws on self-learning algorithms and heterogeneous data sources, crime prediction software will likely be integrated into assemblages of predictive technologies where criminal events are indeed foreclosed before they can unfold and emerge, implying preemptive police action.",1043-9463,1477-2728,2020,30,8,905,919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10439463.2019.1611821,May-19,22/02/2024
226,,Journey to crime of itinerant crime groups,"Purpose - Most researchers have found that property crimes have a local focus: offenders tend to operate in the vicinity of their residence. This has led the police to organise themselves to concentrate their resources in highly populated, urban areas, Over the last decade mobile property offenders have been found in various Western European countries that differ from this norm. These groups of mainly Eastern European multiple offenders engaging in property crime tend to travel further than other offenders. As such, their operations differ from most criminals, challenging the way the police are organised and undermining criminological theories on journey to crime. The aim of this paper is to look at the specificity of mobility patterns of these groups, to examine the precise interpretation of their mobility and to consider the implications. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the Belgian police database containing all serious property crimes in Belgium for the period 2002-2006. Some basic offender characteristics have been identified and for these offenders journey-to-crime patterns have been established. Findings - Eastern European multiple offending groups tend to commit their crimes in rural areas. Although they start their journey in regions considered crime importing, they carry out their crimes in crime exporting areas. As such, they are atypical, challenging traditional theories on journey-to-crime and the way in which police forces are organised. Research limitations/implications - Observing a special group is one thing, but explaining these differences is another. Further research is needed, in particular with regard to the motivational aspects for these offenders. Originality/value - Whereas most researchers have found crime (including property crime) to be mainly local, the present research focuses on more mobile offenders. The challenges that these groups create for law enforcement authorities make it important for them and their patterns of activity to be understood.",1363-951X,1758-695X,2010,33,2,339,353,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13639511011044920,,22/02/2024
227,,A street segment analysis of crime in a township: evidence from South Africa,"Street segments as a micro-level unit of analysis have become increasingly popular in spatial crime research with a plethora of studies having shown how crime spatially concentrates at this spatial scale. The vast majority of this research has, however, emanated from the United States and other 'Westernized' cities, with little attention on less developed contexts. Developing countries have different structural and design conditions from developed countries and this could be reflected in micro-spatial crime patterns. In this study, we undertook the first street segment analysis of crime in southern Africa with a particular focus on the township of Khayelitsha, located approximately 30 kilometers from Cape Town. Townships are uniquely South African urban settlements, borne out of repressive apartheid-era spatial planning policies. Results showed that violent, property, and sexual crimes concentrate spatially in Khayelitsha at the street segment level with substantial street-to-street variability. From a practical perspective, so-called 'hot streets' should be the primary focus of intervention by law enforcement agencies tasked with reducing crime in countries with far less resources than their Global North counterparts. We recommend replication of this analysis in other African contexts in order to build up a body of evidence to either support or challenge the notion of 'crime concentration at micro-places' commonly advocated by international scholars.",1561-4263,1477-271X,2023,24,5,539,557,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15614263.2022.2147070,Dec-22,22/02/2024
228,,"Who 'Tweets' Where and When, and How Does it Help Understand Crime Rates at Places? Measuring the Presence of Tourists and Commuters in Ambient Populations","Objectives Test the reliability of geotagged Twitter data for estimating block-level population metrics across place types. Evaluate whether the proportion of Twitter users on a block at a given time who are local residents, inter-metro commuters, or tourists is correlated with incidences of public violence and private conflict for four different time periods: weekday days, weekday nights, weekend days, and weekend nights. Methods DBSCAN* machine learning technique is used to estimate the home clusters of 54,249 Twitter users who sent at least one geotagged tweet in Boston. Public violence and private conflict are measured using geocoded 911 dispatches. ANOVA models are used to evaluate how the presence of our three groups of interests varies across three types of block-level land usage. Hierarchical linear regression models are used to evaluate whether the proportion of commuters and tourists at census tract- and block-levels are predictive of crime events across the four time periods of interest. Results We find evidence that Twitter data has limited reliability across residential blocks due to data sparseness. For non-residential blocks, we find that commuter and tourist presence at the block-level are positively associated with both public violence and private conflict, but that these effects are not stable across time periods. Commuters and tourists only effect violence during weekday days, and the effects of commuters and tourists on private conflict are only statistically significant during weekday days and weekend days. Conclusions Consistent with routine activities and crime pattern theories, the influx of outsiders in a given location impacts the likelihood of crime occurring there. While we find that data from Twitter users can be valuable for measuring block-level ambient populations, it appears this is not true for residential blocks. Future research may further consider how the characteristics of Twitter users may inform spatial patterns in crime.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2021,37,2,333,359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-020-09487-1,Jan-21,22/02/2024
229,,Physical Boundaries and City Boundaries: Consequences for Crime Patterns on Street Segments?,"Scholars have theorized how spatial boundaries (edges) can be important for understanding the location of crime, yet the empirical relationship between spatial boundaries in the environment and levels of crime is relatively less explored compared with other features of the environment. The current study extends the literature by not only studying three types of physical boundariesinterstate highways, parks, and riversbut also one nonphysical and relatively less visible boundarycity boundaries. We analyze the relationship between crime in street segments and nearness to these four types of edges in the Southern California area. We measure nearness to these boundaries in two manners: (a) whether or not the segment is adjacent to the feature and (b) how far in physical distance the segment is to the feature.",0011-1287,1552-387X,2018,64,2,227,254,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0011128716687756,,22/02/2024
230,,The Impact of Drug Market Pulling Levers Policing on Neighborhood Violence An Evaluation of the High Point Drug Market Intervention,"Pulling levers policing draws upon the focused deterrence framework, which has shown considerable promise when directed at youth, gun, and gang offenders. However, much less is known about the viability of pulling levers when applied to different contexts as well as to diverse groups of offenders. We examine the High Point (North Carolina) Drug Market Intervention (DMI), the first site to use pulling levers as a place-based policing approach to disrupt a series of open-air drug markets across the city. Eleven years of longitudinal data are analyzed by using difference-in-difference panel regression analyses combined with finite mixture estimation as a means to test for divergence in violent crime patterns. Several key, although inconsistent, findings are presented. First, we found a statistically significant reduction in violent offenses in specific high-crime places (i.e., high-trajectory census blocks) located across the different targeted neighborhoods compared with the remainder of High Point, and relative to comparable nontargeted areas. Second, the citywide violent crime rate actually increased after a series of interventions unfolded, which may suggest limitations with the approach. Finally, trend analyses indicated the strategy had different levels of violent crime impact throughout unique geographic contexts. Policy Implications Rather than arresting every offender identified as having participated in illicit drug trafficking across various geographic contexts within the city, officials in High Point decided to invite low-risk drug offenders to community notification sessions in order to change their perceived risk of punishment as well as to mobilize community members across the different targeted neighborhoods. The suggestive evidence of potential, although limited, violent crime impact illustrates that this type of policing strategy may hold considerable promise. This interpretation gains credence when considered with prior evaluations of the DMI approach that illustrated the potential for reducing drug-related crime and in light of reports of improved police-community relations. The inconsistent findings across all locations and the overall city increase in violent crime toward the end of the study period, however, raise several concerns when interpreting study results. Additionally, our findings suggest that further replications should include systematic problem-identification, process measures, and more precise research designs.",1538-6473,1745-9133,2012,11,2,167,+,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2012.00798.x,,22/02/2024

The Influence of Nationwide Conditions on Local Crime Patterns,"This study considers the degree to which the crime rates of US cities follow a uniform national trend. A nationwide trend has consequences for theories that explain aggregate changes in crime, but how closely subnational units hold to a common time path has received almost no research attention. Using annual panel data, the current study presents analyses that attempt to measure the correspondence between city-level and national-level crime rates. The results of each analysis are consistent with a clear single pattern that operates across the nation's major urban areas.

233,,"Crime displacement: what we know, what we don't know, and what it means for crime reduction","If offending were simply displaced following (often spatially) focused crime reduction initiatives, the continued expenditure of resources on this approach to crime reduction would be pointless. The aims of this article were to: critically appraise the current body of displacement research; identify gaps in understanding; articulate an agenda for future research; and to consider the implications of the accumulated findings for practitioners, evaluators, and policy makers. First, we review existing criminological theory regarding crime displacement and the alternative perspective-that crime prevention activity might generate a diffusion of crime control benefits. Second, we review the empirical research, focusing in particular on the findings of existing systematic reviews. Third, we consider the types of displacement that might occur and the methodological approaches employed to study them. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that displacement is far from inevitable and that a diffusion of crime control benefit is at least as likely. However, some forms of displacement have not been adequately studied. Existing research suggests that successful crime reduction interventions often have a positive impact on crime that extends beyond the direct recipients of a particular project. However, current understanding of crime displacement and how benefits might diffuse remains incomplete. Consequently, to inform an agenda for future research, we derive a typology of methodological issues associated with studying displacement, along with suggestions as to how they might be addressed.",1573-3750,1572-8315,2014,10,4,549,571,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11292-014-9209-4,,22/02/2024

Hotspots also have a temporal component, yet police recorded crime databases rarely record the actual time of offense as this is seldom known. Police crime data tends, more often than not, to reflect the routine activities of the victims rather than the offense patterns of the offenders. This paper demonstrates a technique that uses police START and END crime times to generate a crime occurrence probability at any given time that can be mapped or visualized graphically.

236,,Ethnic differences in intergenerational crime patterns,"Some disadvantaged minority groups in Western countries have elevated rates of crime. Others do not. The experience of diverse minority groups in England and Wales, primarily postcolonial migrants since World War II, provides a case study. The highest levels of poverty and disadvantage occur among Bangladeshis and Pakistanis, and the lowest among Indians and African Asians. Afro-Caribbeans have achieved middling levels of prosperity. Crime rates in the first generation appear to have been low among all of these groups. They rose sharply in the second generation among Afro-Caribbeans but not among the South Asian groups. One reason for this divergence was the legacy of slavery, which led to rapid changes in the Afro-Caribbean family after migration that loosened constraints on crime and antisocial behavior. Another was their British cultural inheritance, which led Afro-Caribbean migrants to expect more from British people and to interact with them more freely. This outgoing style of life led to frequent experiences of rejection. Young Afro-Caribbeans responded by finding a positive source of identity in rebellion against white authority, leading to elevated crime rates.",0192-3234,,2005,32,,59,129,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/655353,,22/02/2024

Methods Forty-four street segments were randomized into treatment (N = 22) and control (N = 22) conditions across nine chronic, persistent violent crime areas. The conditions (foot patrols, stationary patrol vehicles, and business-as-usual) were active for 6 months. Results Over 90% of the hot spots experienced an average of 1.5 h or greater of patrol dosage per day. In terms of impact, the mixed effects negative binomial regression results showed that the addition of HSP had a marginally significant reduction on overall crime (- 21%), a statistically significant reduction on overall calls for service (- 25.7%), and a statistically significant reduction of 34% on violent calls for service. Conclusions Reductions in crime and calls for service occurred in settings where enhanced patrol resources were already deployed. The findings did not demonstrate any evidence of a ceiling effect for HSP to impact crime and violence, even where additional patrol resources were already higher than normal.",1573-3750,1572-8315,2023,19,1,213,235,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11292-021-09485-8,Oct-21,22/02/2024
238,,How Far to Travel? A Multilevel Analysis of the Residence-to-Crime Distance,"This study investigates whether individual- and area-level factors explain variation in the residence-to-crime distances (RC distance) for 10 offense types. Five years of police data from Dallas, Texas, are analyzed using multilevel models (hierarchical-linear/multi-level modeling). Residence-to-crime distances for Dallas offenders varied notably across offense types. Although several area characteristics such as residential instability and concentrated immigration were associated with the overall variance in RC distance, neither these nor the individual-level characteristics used in our models explained the offense-type variance in the RC distance. Although individual- and neighborhood-level factors did not explain substantial variation in RC distance across the various offenses, neighborhood-level factors explained a significant portion of neighborhood-level variance. Other finding included a curvilinear effect of age on RC distance. The salience of these findings and their implications for future research and offender travel theory are discussed.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2015,31,2,237,262,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-014-9232-7,,22/02/2024

240,,GENERAL THEORY OF SPATIAL CRIME PATTERNS,"I propose a general theory for examining the spatial distribution of crime by specifically addressing and estimating the spatial distribution of the residences of offenders, targets, guardians, and their respective expected movement patterns across space and time. The model combines information on the locations of persons, typical spatial movement patterns, and situational characteristics of locations to create estimates of crime potential at various locations at various points in time and makes four key contributions. First, the equations make the ideas involved in the theory explicit, and they highlight points at which our current state of empirical evidence is lacking. Second, by creating measures of spatial potentials of offenders, targets, and guardians, this theory provides a precise grounding for operationalizing spatial effects in studies of place and crime. Third, the equations provide an explicit consideration of offenders and where they might travel and, therefore, incorporates offenders into crime-and-place research. Fourth, these equations suggest ways that researchers could use simulations to predict stable patterns, as well as changes, in the levels of crime at both micro and macro scales. Finally, I provide an empirical demonstration of the added explanatory power provided by the theory to a study of place and crime.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2016,54,4,653,679,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12117,,22/02/2024
241,,"Pathways: Examining Street Network Configurations, Structural Characteristics and Spatial Crime Patterns in Street Segments","Objectives Although theories suggest that street network configurations (pathways) are important factors for understanding the spatial patterns of crime, relatively less attention has been paid to the association between the physical configuration of the street network and the level of crime in place. Consequently, we employed the concept of betweenness centrality in the context of the street network to empirically measure the potential foot traffic passing through a given street segment. Methods We introduce a methodological refinement by accounting for the characteristics of origin and destination of each potential trip (where travelers are from and tend to go) using residential population in origins and destinations and the number of various types of business employees in destinations. Moreover, we posit that the effect of potential foot traffic into a given street segment will be moderated by certain social environmental characteristics such as socioeconomic status of place. By using data on a sample of 300,000 street segments in the Southern California region across 130 cities, we estimate a set of negative binomial regression models including the betweenness measures. Results Our results show that betweenness centrality has a curvilinear relationship with violent and property crime: At lower levels, increases in betweenness results in increased crime, yet the pattern becomes crime-reducing at higher values of the betweenness measure. We also found that the pattern is moderated by the socioeconomic status of the street segment. Conclusions The current study highlights that there is an important relationship of the physical environment in terms of the street network configuration and crime in street segments.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2020,36,4,725,752,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-019-09428-7,,22/02/2024

This study evaluates the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temporal and spatial patterns of crime in three major cities under very different national contexts. Each of the three countries and cities experienced different levels of pandemic restrictions and societal closure. The cities of New York (the United States), Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Stockholm (Sweden) were selected as cases. Temporal quantitative methods, spatial statistics techniques, and Geographical Information System (GIS) underlie the methodology used in this study. Findings show that there is a statistically significant break in the trend in crime levels after the stay-at-home orders were implemented in New York City, Sao Paulo, and Stockholm in the first months of 2020; the only exception was for murder. Such an impact varies by crime type and city context, but increases again after a few months, indicating how fast crime and criminals adapt. Residential burglary decreased, whereas nonresidential burglary increased overall. Changes in the levels and geography of vehicle thefts were observed, with an overall increase of significant cold spots but, in several cases, also solidification of existing crime concentrations in known crime attractors and in some deprived areas.",1043-9862,1552-5406,2022,38,1,120,149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10439862211038471,Sep-21,22/02/2024
243,,CRIME DIVERSITY,"Large geographic areas should host a greater diversity of crime compared with small geographic areas. This proposition is reasonable given that larger geographic areas should not only support more crime but also contain a greater diversity of criminogenic settings. This article uses a neutral model to characterize crime richness as a function of area. The model starts with two neutral assumptions: 1) that all environments are statistically equivalent and exert no influence on what types of crimes occur there; and 2) that different crime types occur independently of one another. The model produces rigorous predictions for the mean and variance in crime richness with increasing area. Tests of the model against a sample of 172,055 crimes occurring in Los Angeles during the year 2013 are qualitatively consistent with neutral expectations. The model is made quantitatively consistent by constant scaling. Resampling experiments show that at most 20 percent of the mean crime richness is attributable to nonrandom clustering and assortment of crime types. A modified neutral model allowing for variation crime concentration is consistent with observed variance in crime richness. The results suggest that very general and largely neutral laws may be driving crime diversity in space.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2016,54,4,553,586,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12116,,22/02/2024

245,,The Influence of Stadia and the Built Environment on the Spatial Distribution of Crime,"Objectives The aim of this study was to explore the influence of micro- (e.g., pubs and fast-food restaurants) and super-facilities on area level counts of crime. Soccer stadia were selected as an example of a super-facility as their episodic use provides conditions not unlike a natural experiment. Of particular interest was whether the presence of such facilities, and their influence on the flow of people through neighborhoods on match days affects crime. Consideration was also given to how the social composition of a neighborhood might influence crime. Methods Crime, street network, and points of interest data were obtained for the areas around five UK soccer stadia. Counts of crime were computed for small areal units and the spatial distribution of crime examined for match and non-match days. Variables derived from graph theory were generated to estimate how micro-facilities might influence the movement flows of people on match days. Spatial econometric analyses were used to test hypotheses. Results Mixed support was found for the influence of neighborhood social composition on crime for both match and non-match days. Considering the influence of facilities, a selective pattern emerged with crime being elevated in those neighborhoods closest to stadia on match but not non-match days. Micro-facilities too were found to influence crime levels. Particularly clear was the finding that the influence of pubs and fast-food restaurants on estimated movement flows to and from stadia on match (but not non-match) days was associated with area level crime. Conclusions Our findings provide further support for ecological theories of crime and how factors that influence the likely convergence of people in urban spaces affect levels of crime.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2021,37,2,573,604,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-019-09440-x,Dec-19,22/02/2024

Exploring the content of reviews posted online could expose criminogenic conditions associated with properties, thereby providing an opportunity to examine crime problems afflicting private facilities with public data. This study investigates whether Yelp comments, together with property characteristics, can account for crime and deviance occurring at or near casinos in Southern California. While a correlational analysis revealed that two Yelp-based variables - property magnetism and star ratings - were associated with fewer reported issues of crime and deviance, a multivariate analysis revealed the complex nature of risky facilities. Holding all other factors constant, perceived staff friendliness and casino magnetism are significantly related to higher crime rates. Notably, the presence of slot machines is associated with lower crime, irrespective of crime measure used. Study limitations restrict generalizability; however, these findings suggest that public data can be used to investigate the criminogenic capacity of risky-facilities.",1478-601X,1478-6028,2019,32,2,140,164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1478601X.2019.1600820,,22/02/2024

248,,Exploring the impact of ambient population measures on London crime hotspots,"Purpose: Crime analysts need accurate population-at-risk measures to quantify crime rates. This research evaluates five measures to find the most suitable ambient population-at-risk estimate for 'theft from the person' crimes. Method: 1. Collect 'ambient' datasets: the 2011 Census, aggregate mobile telephone locations, and social media. 2. Correlate the population measures against crime volumes to identify the strongest predictor. 3. Use the G(i)* statistic to identify statistically significant clusters of crime under alternative denominators. 4. Explore the locations of clusters, comparing those that are significant under ambient and residential population estimates. Results and Discussion: The research identifies the Census workday population as the most appropriate population-at-risk measure. It also highlights areas that exhibit statistically significant rates using both the ambient and residential denominators. This hints at an environmental backcloth that is indicative of both crime generators and attractors - i.e. places that attract large numbers of people for non-crime purposes (generators) as well as places that are used specifically for criminal activity (attractors). Regions that are largely residential and yet only exhibit hotspots under the ambient population might be places with a higher proportion of crime attractors to stimulate crime, but fewer generators to attract volumes of people.

250,,The trends and patterns of crime in Ghana: The case of robbery,"The study utilized the official police data that included the robbery incident addresses/spots to explore the incidence, volume, trends, and patterns of robbery in Ghana from 2014 to 2017. There were 5696 robbery cases of which the highest, 1772 cases, were recorded in 2017, and the lowest cases, 1116 recorded in 2014 reported to the police during this period. The daily average robberies were 3 cases in 2014, 4 cases each in 2015 and 2016, and 5 cases in 2017. The robbery per 100,000 of population in 2014 was 4.1 persons. In 2015, the rate was 5 persons, in 2016 the rate was 4.9 persons and in 2017 it was 6 persons per 100,000 of population. The highest robbery cases were recorded in December, followed by November, September, and May. The Greater Accra region recorded the highest robberies, followed by the Ashanti region, which had the most robbery flashpoints/spots. The Accra-Tema metroplex in the Greater Accra region recorded the highest robbery cases, followed by the city of Kumasi in the Ashanti region. Robbery, an expropriative and serious acquisitive crime whose primary motif is financial gain appears to feed on lifestyles, opportunities, routines, and activities of people. While the arrest rate was small, the robbery related crimes, including robbery -deaths, rapes, and other injuries brought fear and panic among the citizenry. Ghana's robbery statutes, and law enforcement responses, including shooting death of suspects, and public lynching of some suspects do not appear to deter the robbery menace.

251,,Is It Dangerous to Live in Neighborhoods with More Immigrants? Assessing the Effects of Immigrant Concentration on Crime Patterns,"The immigration-crime nexus has been the subject of much empirical attention and research findings consistently indicate that neighborhoods with large immigrant populations exhibit comparatively lower crime rates. However, it is still imperative to explain how these effects take place in different contexts of structural circumstances of communities.

252,,Cross-border crime patterns unveiled by exchange of DNA profiles in the European Union,"The aim of this study was to make a head start with unveiling transnational spatial patterns in offending. To that end, data are used from DNA profile exchange between The Netherlands and 18 other EU member states that have implemented EU legislation on forensic cooperation. Information was collected on all DNA stains entered into the database, including the region in The Netherlands where the stain was secured, the type of crime and how many matching DNA profiles had been identified in each of the other 18 countries. The results suggest that currently the profiles of offenders who are active in other Pram countries make up for about 4 per cent of all DNA stain profiles in the Dutch DNA database. The highest share of cross-border matches is found in the southeastern part of The Netherlands, where The Netherlands borders one of the most densely populated regions of Germany.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2016,29,4,640,660,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/sj.2015.27,,22/02/2024

Methods Using unpublished data from 166 countries covering the period between 2006 and 2019, the article describes the geographical distribution across global regions and trends over time of three types of common crime, homicide, and organised crime. The article then explores possible determinants of the geographical distributions through regressing prevalence rates against indices of poverty, inequality, proportion of youth, presence of criminal opportunities (wealth and urbanisation), and governance/rule of law. Results The results show that African and Latin American countries suffer from the highest levels of various types of crime across the board, followed by countries in Asia. European, North American and Australian countries experience intermediate or relatively low levels of most types of crime. Levels of common crime have dropped or stabilized globally except in Africa where they went up. Homicides have fallen almost universally. Trends in organised crime are diverging. Conclusions Dimensions of governance emerged as powerful determinants of levels of all types of crime. Important determinants of common crime besides governance were poverty, inequality, and proportion of youth. To some extent changes in these same characteristics of countries were found to be correlated with changes in levels of crime over the past fifteen years.

254,,Crime drop in Ghana? Some insights from crime patterns and trends,"This study examines crime rate trends in Ghana in the context of research into the international crime drop. Ghanaian police-recorded crime data are imperfect, but crime rates appear to have increased to the early 2000s then to have declined significantly. However, the national trend for all crime types masks significant variation by crime type and region. The national trends appear, broadly speaking, consistent with long-term crime increases and decreases in high-income countries, but with a lag that may reflect Ghana's economic development trajectory. This may be consistent with the routine activity perspective if both crime opportunities and economic development increased in parallel, followed by a crime decline that reflected increased security measures or other change. The study raises many questions that require further research, and some suggestions to that end are outlined.",1460-3780,1743-4629,2021,23,4,433,449,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41300-021-00130-0,Sep-21,22/02/2024

Examining Relationships Between Release Location Choices, Community Experiences, and Recidivism for High-Risk Parolees","This study investigated the effects of residential relocation in a sample of 282 high-risk male offenders paroled from New Zealand prisons. Initially we compared those returning to their old neighborhoods (devil you know) and those released to a new location (fresh start). This second category was then further divided: those released to a new location voluntarily (fresh start-voluntary) versus those forced to start anew at the behest of the parole board that was releasing them (fresh start-duress). All three categories were then compared on the quality of their community experiences and recidivism. Results indicated that parolees returning by choice to either their old neighborhood or a new location each were reconvicted in the first year after release at approximately the same rate; however, parolees relocating to a new area at the direction of the parole board (under duress) were reconvicted at a higher rate than those in either of the voluntary location categories. Significant group differences in ratings of community life quality were few, but there were some indications that compared with those choosing to return to a familiar location, making a voluntary residential relocation may lead to better parole experiences, particularly in terms of avoiding criminal peers, and that making a residential relocation under duress may lead to poorer parole experiences than for those returning to a familiar location.",0306-624X,1552-6933,2020,64,06-Jul,635,653,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624X19877589,,22/02/2024

This study simultaneously integrated these different perspectives, including crime generators and attractors and environmental disorder indicators, to determine the most influential, salient, and consistent predictors of micro-level crime hot spots in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hot spot and control units were compared based on the presence of spatially joined crime generators and attractors and environmental disorder indicators recorded via remote systematic social observation using Google Street View. The results indicate that crime generators and attractors tend to vary in significance, influence, saliency, and consistency across crime types. Alternatively, the presence of decay in hot spots may be the most prominent and stable environmental feature. Environmental criminology has placed an increased focus on crime generators and attractors, though, it may be time to assess the theoretical and practical importance of other criminogenic environmental elements like decay.",0741-8825,1745-9109,2023,40,5,670,693,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2022.2106292,Jul-22,22/02/2024

The Earthquakes resulted in widespread structural damage to Christchurch, the main city of the region, and greatly impacted other aspects of society including crime. In this study, we adopt an exploratory approach to investigate the impact that these earthquakes have had on the temporal and spatial patterning of four types of crime in Christchurch: assault, domestic violence, burglary and arson. Overall crime has decreased in post-quake Christchurch with the notable exception of domestic violence. We found remarkably similar temporal signatures of crime for all crime types occurring across both the pre- and post-earthquake periods. Spatially, crime has increased in the majority of neighbourhoods in Christchurch post-quake despite overall crime levels being down.

261,,Comparing global spatial patterns of crime,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the spatial patterns of different phenomena in the same geographical space. Andresen's spatial point pattern test computes a global index (the S-index) that informs on the similarity or dissimilarity of spatial patterns. This paper suggests a generalized S-index that allows perfect similarity and dissimilarity in all situations. Design/methodology/approach The relevance of the generalized S-index is illustrated with police data from the San Francisco Police Department. In all cases, the original S-index, its robust version - which excludes zero-crime areas - and the generalized alternative were computed. Findings In the first example, the number of crimes greatly exceeds the number of areas and there are no zero-value areas. A key feature of the second example is that most street segments were free of any criminal activity in both patterns. Finally, in the third case, one type of event is considerably rarer than the other. The original S-index is equal to the generalized index (Case 1) or theoretically irrelevant (Cases 2 and 3). Furthermore, the robust index is unnecessary and potentially biased when the number of at least one phenomenon being compared is lower than the number of areas under study. Thus, this study suggests to replace the S-index with its generalized version. Originality/value The generalized S-index is relevant for situations when events are relatively rare -as is the case with crime - and the unit of analysis is small but plentiful - such as addresses or street segments.",1363-951X,1758-695X,2019,42,6,1097,1106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/PIJPSM-05-2019-0073,,22/02/2024

This article examines the results of two nearly identical studies examining the relationship between neighborhood parks and crime, in two very dissimilar cities, Philadelphia, PA and Louisville, KY. These cities vary greatly in size, population density, median income, per cent minorities and per cent living in poverty, among other factors. Findings of the studies, which are grounded in theories of environmental criminology, show that neighborhood parks are associated with increased crime levels in their immediate surroundings. In addition, although characteristics of parks significantly related to crime levels in each city vary somewhat, findings clearly demonstrate the underlying importance guardianship plays is explaining the criminogenic nature of neighborhood parks.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2017,30,3,807,824,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/sj.2015.11,,22/02/2024
264,,The Influence of Temporal Specification on the Identification of Crime Hot Spots for Program Evaluations: A Test of Longitudinal Stability in Crime Patterns,"Objectives Longitudinal studies from the criminology of place suggest crime hot spots are repeatedly found in the same locations within cities over extended periods of time. Program evaluations of hot spots policing interventions often use much shorter temporal windows to define hot spots. This study examines if stability of patterns is still found when using short and intermediate periods of time to measure crime hot spots. Methods We examined 765,235 total crime incidents reported to the Cincinnati Police Department from 1997 to 2016. These incidents were geocoded to 13,189 street segments. We created measures of crime hot spots based on varying temporal periods using three different strategies: pooled observations, group-based trajectory modeling, and k-means clustering. These measures were compared using techniques associated with survival analyses to determine the influence of temporal specification on the retrospective identification of crime hot spots. Results Our findings suggest regardless of the temporal specification, most street segments identified as crime hot spots remained crime hot spots across the observed follow-up periods. There was still much variability in patterns based upon temporal specifications and the use of additional years of incident report data did not uniformly provide an improved understanding of which street segments remained crime hot spots. Conclusions Program evaluations of hot spots policing strategies do not need to use extended periods of time to observe stability in crime hot spots. The criminology of place should provide more attention to the topic of temporal specification and continue exploring the utility of crime hot spots.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2022,38,1,51,74,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-020-09483-5,Nov-20,22/02/2024

The theoretical framework is provided by a stress-support model which postulates that crime in society will be positively related to stress factors and negatively related to support systems. Eight stress indicators and four support (solidarity) indicators were included. The data regarding these indicators were derived from continuing surveys of representative samples of the urban population in Israel during the years 1967-1979. The theoretical model was supported by the findings, especially those relating to property offenses. The effects of the female indicators were strongest (and greater than those of males) with regard to property offenses. The regression coefficients of the female indicators were also consistently larger than those of males, indicating that women's perceptions of stress are better predictors of crime rates than those of males. The results are compared to those of previous studies and suggestions are made for future studies in this new line of criminological research.",0748-4518,,1997,13,1,29,56,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02362171,,22/02/2024

Taking these features into account, in addition to individual traits and behaviors, might pave the way for more accurate risk assessment that could help make supervision sensitive to place-based risks. However, multivariate survival analysis of 1,632 parolees released to Newark during July 2007 to June 2009 found little evidence that these factors increased the risk of failure.

Method Geocoded commercial burglary data for 2003-2021 from San Francisco were analyzed using the Andresen Spatial Point Pattern Test to examine potential spatial movement in commercial burglary. Results Concentrations of commercial burglary spatially shifted following the emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent stay-at-home orders. Original hot spots experienced a relative decrease in commercial burglary, and crime spread out throughout the city. These spatial changes in commercial burglary appear to be related to variations in guardianship and criminal opportunity. Conclusion These findings suggest that the dramatic shifts in routine activities resulting from the COVID-19 policies could disrupt spatial burglary patterns, especially burglary clustering.

Our study is aimed at better understanding this link. Methods: Focusing on a high-crime neighborhood in Ohio, we use spatial video and calls for service (CFS) to examine how crime changed on streets where abandoned homes were removed. We also draw on the insights of 35 ex-offenders, police officers, and residents to examine how and why abandoned houses are connected to crime in this locale. Results: On average, streets where abandoned houses were razed accounted for a lower proportion of neighborhood crime after removal. Also, a lower proportion of total CFS from these streets related to serious crime. Our narrative data indicate that abandoned houses are opportunistic because they provide cover, unoccupied spaces, and are easy targets. Conclusions: The removal of abandoned housing was associated with positive changes in crime overall; however, our approach revealed interesting variation across streets. We surmise that the relevance of a particular abandoned house may be contingent on the larger context of that street or neighborhood. In order to understand these dynamics, future research should continue to drill down into micro-spaces.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2019,56,3,378,411,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427818807965,,22/02/2024
269,,Cohort Variation in US Violent Crime Patterns from 1960 to 2014: An Age-Period-Cohort-Interaction Approach,"Objectives Previous research in criminology has overlooked that cohort effects on crime should beage-time-specific(Ryder in Am Sociol Rev 30(6):843-861, 1965) and consequently assumed cohort effects to be the same across the life course. The current study addresses these limitations by modeling cohort effects as the differential impacts of social change depending on age groups. With this new operationalization that is closely tied to Ryder's conceptualization, we examine both inter-cohort differences and intra-cohort dynamics in violent crime. Methods We use the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model developed by Luo and Hodges (Sociol Methods Res 2020) to analyze the UCR age-specific arrest statistics for robbery, aggravated assaults, and homicide from 1960 to 2014. Specifically, we estimate and test two types of cohort variation: average cohort deviations and life-course dynamics. Results Our findings reveal varying degrees of cohort deviations at different ages. The early boomers (born between 1945 and 1954) and the late boomers (born between 1955 and 1964) demonstrate different intra-cohort dynamics of robbery arrest, and the violence epidemic cohorts' (born between 1975 and 1984) high risks of homicide arrest appear to be driven by cohort deviations at young ages. Conclusions The APC-I framework introduced in this study provides new insights into the dynamic aspect of cohort effects on violent crime that have not been examined in the criminological literature. Criminological studies on cohort effects would benefit by shifting away from the problematic assumption of constant and additive cohort effects to the dynamic and interactive approach represented by the APC-I framework.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2021,37,4,1047,1081,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-020-09477-3,Oct-20,22/02/2024

Conventional knowledge suggests that because patrol officers work specific geographical areas (beats) on a fairly constant basis, they come to see where the problems exist; thus, police experience alone can be relied on to identify crime problems. However, few have examined whether officers are effective in identifying problems in their areas. This research examined the consistency of officer problem identification across focus groups for an entire police department in terms of the kinds of problems identified, the location of problems, and the suggested responses. Although there was little consistency across,focus groups, officers were able to identify specific sites or properties thought to generate high levels of disorder-related calls.

Police-recorded data for five football stadia for a 6-year timeframe (2005-2010) are examined using non-parametric permutation tests. The spatial extent of any patterns are quantified and used to further examine differences in the temporal distribution of crime and incidents. Change in the spatial distribution of crime and incidents occurred around all five stadia and did so during those periods when the ambient population was elevated on match days. The results provide further support for theories of environmental criminology, suggesting that there is a higher risk of crime and incidents in the areas immediately around stadia during the hours when matches take place.",0955-1662,1743-4645,2018,31,3,665,684,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41284-017-0123-0,,22/02/2024

Many macro-level theories do make predictions about the sort of crimes that occur in some neighborhoods, although they remain largely untested. This study focuses on one of these theories, differential opportunity, and its predictions about the making of violent neighborhoods. Drawing on various data sources, this inquiry determines whether crime profiles differ across Chicago neighborhoods that is, whether there is significant variation across neighborhoods on ratio of violent crimes to other crime types. Next, it also investigates whether the structural factors implicated in the differential opportunity perspective distinguish these neighborhoods or only predict the incidence of crime. The results reveal significant differences in the distribution of crimes across neighborhoods, as well as show that certain factors identify neighborhoods that favor violence over other crimes.",0741-8825,1745-9109,2009,26,4,771,794,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418820902763079,,22/02/2024

Although there is a growing body of research examining the association between specific land uses and perceptions of risk, these studies have generally measured land uses individually rather than in a grouped theoretical context or in terms of homogeneous categories; the latter are hampered by inadequate theoretical application and a failure to recognize differences in the effects of land uses that share common characteristics.

Separate analyses of each individual year reveal both similarities and differences between years.

The analysis is conducted using Bayesian structural time-series and focuses on nine crime categories and on the overall crime count, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020. We concentrate on two post-intervention time windows-from March 4th to March 16th and from March 4th to March 28th 2020-to dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and strict policies. In Los Angeles, overall crime has significantly decreased, as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft, and battery. No significant effect has been detected for vehicle theft, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, intimate partner assault, and homicide. Results suggest that, in the first weeks after the interventions are put in place, social distancing impacts more directly on instrumental and less serious crimes. Policy implications are also discussed.",1066-2316,1936-1351,2021,46,5,704,727,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09578-6,Oct-20,22/02/2024
280,,Predictive Policing as a New Tool for Law Enforcement? Recent Developments and Challenges,"Decision-making processes are increasingly based on intelligence gained from big data', i.e., extensive but complex datasets. This evolution of analyzing complex data using methods aimed at prediction is also emerging within the field of quantitative criminology. In the context of crime analysis, the large amount of crime data available can be considered an example of big data, which could inform us about current and upcoming crime trends and patterns. A recent development in the analysis of this kind of data is predictive policing, which uses advanced statistical methods to make the most of these data to gain useable new insights and information, allowing police services to predict and anticipate future crime events. This article presents the results of a literature review, supplemented with key informant interviews, to give insight into what predictive policing is, how it can be used and implemented to anticipate crime, and what is known about its effectiveness. It also gives an overview of the currently known applications of predictive policing and their main characteristics.",0928-1371,1572-9869,2018,24,3,201,218,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10610-017-9361-2,,22/02/2024
281,,Space-time analysis of theft from persons in Pereira (2019-2021). An approach to the theory of environmental munificence for crime,"The COVID-19 contingency gave rise to multiple social interactions for which neither governments nor citizens were prepared. The restrictive measures on mobility imposed by the National Government produced a series of changes not only in social dynamics and legal transactions, but also in the criminal context. The purpose of this study is to understand the space-time behavior of theft in the metropolitan area of Pereira, Colombia, and to compare this behavior observed under normal conditions and in times of pandemic. Data were obtained by consulting the Siedco application for the city studied in the 2019-2021 time window. The spatial analysis was performed using the technique known as pattern identification for space-time event networks (Ipree). The empirical evidence observed allows us to conclude that there is a space-time configuration that defines the dynamics of thefts in the city of Pereira and these patterns can be explained from the theory of environmental munificence for crime.",1794-3108,2256-5531,2023,65,1,121,137,http://dx.doi.org/10.47741/17943108.405,,22/02/2024
282,,Exploring Directional Consistency in Offending: The Case of Residential Burglary in The Hague,"Many aspects of human behaviour are remarkably stable across times, places and situations. Repetition and predictability also characterises our geographical behaviour. Prior research has confirmed that criminal behaviour is no exception. Offenders tend to recidivate, and recidivists tend to be behaviourally consistent in many aspects, including geographical ones. The present study assesses directional consistency in offending. It reviews the literature on directional consistency. It proposes an improved measure of directional consistency, and empirically uses this measure to explore directional consistency amongst a set of 268 burglars in The Hague.

283,,The Topography of Robbery: Does Slope Matter?,"Objectives To examine the influence of street block slope on robbery in Cincinnati, Ohio. Methods Data visualizations were used to examine how street block slope varies across the city. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the influence of street block slope on robbery net of betweenness, facility composition, and socio-demographics. Results A 1% increase in street block slope was associated with roughly 4.5% fewer street block robberies per foot of street block length. Street blocks with a higher expected usage potential, measured via betweenness, were also observed to have higher expected robbery levels. In addition, numerous facilities and neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics linked to higher robbery levels. Conclusions Steeper street blocks may have fewer robberies because they make the physical costs for committing robberies too high, are too difficult to escape from, and/or provide fewer robbery opportunities due to relatively lower usage. Moreover, more robberies appear to occur on street blocks with higher betweenness due to more potential opportunities there. Finally, the influence of facilities and community characteristics were largely consistent with theoretical expectations and past studies. Future studies should continue to examine how topography influences aggregate crime levels and offender decision making in other settings to bolster the external validity of the present findings.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2021,37,3,625,645,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-020-09451-z,Jan-20,22/02/2024
284,,"Perceived sanction risk, individual propensity and adolescent offending: Assessing key findings from the deterrence literature in a Dutch sample","Deterrence studies have shown that perceived sanction risk is related to delinquent behaviour, independent of other variables, and that this relation may be conditioned by individual propensity towards crime. The principal goal of this study is to assess these findings with data from a sample of 843 Dutch adolescents. First, we analysed whether perceived sanction risk (perceived apprehension risk and perceived consequences if one is caught offending) has a relationship with offending, independent of one's morality and self-control. Second, we examined possible interactions between perceived sanction risk and self-control, and between perceived sanction risk and morality. We also explored associations between specific offences (burglary, vandalism and assault), offence-specific measures of low morality (how right or wrong are burglary, vandalism and assault) and specific measures of perceived sanction risks. The findings demonstrate that perceived sanction risk is related to lower offending and that self-control is related to less offending, whereas low levels of morality are related to higher levels of offending. When offence-specific measures are used, the relation between perceived sanctions and offending seems to be dependent on one's level of morality. Our results suggest that the less a person morally supports specific types of offending, the more strongly that person is affected by perceived sanctions. The implications of these findings for future studies of deterrence are discussed.",1477-3708,1741-2609,2011,8,5,386,400,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1477370811415762,,22/02/2024
285,,Do Community Structural Characteristics Moderate the Association Between Mental Health and the Frequency and Severity of Violent-Behavioral Outcomes in Community Respondents?,"In this prospective study, we examined the association between three types of mental health symptom clusters (i.e., psychotic, internalizing, and externalizing) and the frequency and severity of violent-behavioral outcomes, and whether community disadvantage, residential instability, and criminogenic facility density moderated these associations. Study data were derived from 258 community-dwelling adults nested in 60 postal forward sortation areas (FSAs) in a large metropolitan area in Western Canada who were assessed twice over a 6-month period. In addition, census and administrative data were obtained on the same areas. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, relationship status, and employment status), lifetime history of violent-behavioral outcomes, and community structural characteristics, internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms were significantly positively associated with the frequency and severity of subsequent violence perpetration and with the severity of subsequent violent victimization. Several significant interactions were observed: internalizing symptoms increased the risk of frequent and severe violence perpetration in FSAs with high but not low disadvantage, and externalizing symptoms increased the risk of frequent violent victimization in FSAs with a high but not low criminogenic facility density. Only the interactive association of internalizing symptoms and community disadvantage with the severity of violence perpetration, however, remained significant after Bonferroni correction was applied. These findings provide tentative support that associations between mental health and violent-behavioral outcomes can vary with community context. The implication of these findings for assessing and managing violent-behavioral outcomes in the community is discussed.",0886-2605,1552-6518,2021,36,21-22,NP11824,NP11851,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260519888204,Dec-19,22/02/2024
286,,RACE AND THE POLICE USE OF FORCE ENCOUNTER IN THE UNITED STATES,"Perennial conflict between police and black citizens has led to calls for greater representation of black officers, yet the presumption that black officers deliver better treatment to-and garner positive reactions from-black citizens has not received sufficient empirical testing. The present examination focusses on the use of force incident, given the symbolism inherent in this encounter. Drawing from prior research and deference exchange theory, this study examines the effects of officer and suspect race in predicting police use of force and suspect resistance. Our findings reveal that white officers are more coercive toward black suspects, but black officers' force usage is unaffected by suspect race. Conversely, officer race does not predict resistance among white or black suspects. Results are discussed in light of implications for theory, police-black relations and police practices.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2018,58,1,54,74,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azw089,,22/02/2024
287,,Tourism and Crime: An Exploratory Study of Burglary From Tourist Accommodation From the Criminal Opportunity Perspective,"It is widely acknowledged that tourists are particularly likely to be victimized, especially with regard to property crimes like theft from tourist accommodation (burglary). Guided by the criminal opportunity perspective, we examine the extent to which environmental and routine activities-related factors explain burglary using the data from a sample of Australian tourists (N = 1,027). Bayesian variable selection with a stochastic search algorithm was used to analyze the data. Our findings demonstrate the utility of opportunity theories in explaining crime against tourists. We found that the location and type of accommodation together with the use of target hardening and guardianship strategies are helpful for understanding burglary from tourist accommodation. Practical implications for crime prevention are also discussed.",0011-1287,1552-387X,2023,69,11,2164,2193,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00111287221106962,Jun-22,22/02/2024
288,,THE IMPACT OF BRITISH COUNTERTERRORIST STRATEGIES ON POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND: COMPARING DETERRENCE AND BACKLASH MODELS,"Since philosophers Beccaria and Bentham, criminologists have been concerned with predicting how governmental attempts to maintain lawful behavior affect subsequent rates of criminal violence. In this article, we build on prior research to argue that governmental responses to a specific form of criminal violence-terrorism-may produce both a positive deterrence effect (i.e., reducing future incidence of prohibited behavior) and a negative backlash effect (i.e., increasing future incidence of prohibited behavior). Deterrence-based models have long dominated both criminal justice and counterterrorist policies on responding to violence. The models maintain that an individual's prohibited behavior can be altered by the threat and imposition of punishment. Backlash models are more theoretically scattered but receive mixed support from several sources, which include research on counterterrorism; the criminology literature on labeling, legitimacy, and defiance; and the psychological literature on social power and decision making. In this article, we identify six major British strategies aimed at reducing political violence in Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1992 and then use a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the impact of these interventions on the risk of new attacks. In general, we find the strongest support for backlash models. The only support for deterrence models was a military surge called Operation Motorman, which was followed by significant declines in the risk of new attacks. The results underscore the importance of considering the possibility that antiterrorist interventions might both increase and decrease subsequent violence.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2009,47,1,17,45,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2009.00138.x,,22/02/2024
289,,An Analysis of Black-White Racial Differences in Public Support for Nonviolent Sentencing Reform,"I examine public support for sentencing reform for nonviolent offenders situated within a justice reinvestment context. I analyze data from a survey administered to a nationally representative sample of White and Black Americans. I pay particular attention to differences in support between the two races, and I analyze the degree to which ideological beliefs explain interracial differences. I find that a larger number of both Black and White people support, rather than oppose, sentencing property and drug offenders to community-based sanctions instead of prison, but the likelihood that a person will express support or opposition is related to several ideological beliefs and demographic characteristics. I find that racism and the belief that the criminal justice system is fair mediate the relationship between race and support for sentencing property offenders to community-based sanctions, but race continues to exert an independent effect in regard to sentencing drug offenders.",2153-3687,,2020,10,4,456,479,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2153368718768388,,22/02/2024
290,,Counterterrorism and Radical Eco-Groups: A Context for Exploring the Series Hazard Model,"This study examines whether radical eco-groups have been deterred by legal sanctions. From a rational choice framework, I argue that members of these groups weigh costs and benefits. I measure an increase in costs, or an objective deterrence effect, through four federal sentencing acts targeted at reducing the criminal behavior of these groups [the tree-spiking clause of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (ADA), the Animal Enterprise Protection Act (AEPA), the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), and the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA)] and hypothesize that this legislation decreased the hazard of subsequent attacks. This research is a quasi-experimental design utilizing the 1,068 illegal incidents perpetrated in the name of the environment, animal, or both as extracted from the Eco-Incidents Database. Using series hazard modeling, I examine the time until the next incident, serious incident, and ideologically specific incident in relation to dummy variables operationalizing the enactment dates of the above legislation. All in all, the results are somewhat consistent with a rational choice framework and my hypotheses. The ADA decreased the hazard of another attack (11 %) and environment-only attack (15 %), while at the same time increasing the hazard of a terrorist, damage, and animal-related attack. AETA decreased the hazard of all (47 %), damage (42 %), and the behavior it was aimed at, that of animal-only incidents (52 %). However, neither the AEPA, nor AEDPA had a significant effect on any of the outcomes. Overall, radical eco-groups were deterred by legal sanctions, but these findings are legislation and outcome specific in addition to including displacement effects.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2014,30,3,485,504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-013-9211-4,,22/02/2024
291,,Predicting Recidivism Among Released Juvenile Offenders in Florida: An Evaluation of the Residential Positive Achievement Change Tool,"Each year in the United States, as many as 100,000 juvenile offenders are released after completing a residential placement. A significant task for researchers is to identify the factors that explain variations in recidivism. This study considers this by evaluating the predictive validity of the Residential Positive Achievement Change Tool (R-PACT), a fourth-generation risk assessment instrument adopted by Florida for use in all of its juvenile residential facilities. The R-PACT includes a wide variety of static and dynamic risk and needs scales that are used here to predict reoffending among 4,700 released juvenile offenders in Florida. We devote special attention to (1) whether R-PACT scales typically predict reoffending and (2) whether the R-PACT's predictive validity varies across different subgroups of offenders. In considering these questions, we also consider whether the predictive risk and protective factors in prior research are predictive in the R-PACT as well. The analysis revealed relatively strong support for the R-PACT, but there were nuanced exceptions to that pattern. We discuss the implications these findings have for assessing risk, monitoring progress among residential youth, and predicting reoffending.",1541-2040,1556-9330,2018,16,1,97,116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1541204016660161,,22/02/2024
292,,Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Terrorist Attacks by ETA 1970 to 2007,"Rational choice perspectives maintain that seemingly irrational behavior on the part of terrorist organizations may nevertheless reflect strategic planning. In this paper we examine spatial and temporal patterns of terrorist attacks by the Spanish group ETA between 1970 and 2007. Our analysis is guided by a public announcement by ETA in 1978 that the group would shift from emphasizing attacks in the Basque territory to instead launch attacks more widely in the hopes of exhausting the Spanish government and forcing it to abandon the Basque territory. This announcement suggests that prior to the end of 1978 ETA attacks were based mostly on controlling territory in the Basque region that they hoped to rule; and after 1978 the organization decided to instead undertake a prolonged war of attrition. Accordingly, we argue that before the end of 1978 ETA was mostly perpetrating control attacks (attacking only within the Basque territories) and that the diffusion of attacks between provinces was mostly contagious (spreading contiguously). After the 1978 proclamation, we argue that the attack strategy shifted toward attrition (attacking in areas outside of the Basque territories) and that the attacks were more likely to diffuse hierarchically (spreading to more distant locations). As predicted, we find that after ETA moved toward a more attrition based attack strategy, subsequent attacks were significantly more likely to occur outside the Basque region and to target non-adjacent regions (consistent with hierarchical diffusion). We also find that hierarchical diffusion was more common when a longer time elapsed between attacks (a likely consequence of the fact that more distant attacks require more resources and planning) and that attacks against Madrid were unlikely to be followed immediately by more attacks on Madrid or surrounding provinces. After ETA announced a shift in policy, they maintained a highly dispersed attack strategy even during their period of decline. Using information about where and when prior attacks occurred could provide useful information for policy makers countering groups like ETA.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2012,28,1,7,29,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-011-9133-y,,22/02/2024
293,,Cost-benefit analysis and privatized corrections,"Research Summary Privatized corrections and cost-benefit analyses have both been around for a long time in American criminal justice policy and practice. Accordingly, in this article, I review the cost-benefit literature on correctional privatization with respect to three primary issues: (1) what we know from the cost-benefit analyses that have been conducted thus far regarding privatized corrections, (2) the key gaps and challenges that should be addressed if we are to truly understand the social ledger associated with privatizing correctional services, and (3) key lessons learned regarding the limited role that cost-benefit analysis plays in policy discussions about punishment policy. Policy Implications The primary implication for policy is that, for the most part, what we know about the cost-effectiveness of privatized corrections has been confined to studies of private prisons. Alternatively, on balance, we know little about the cost-effectiveness of privatized corrections more generally. And even if rigorous cost-benefit analyses did exist in larger quantities, they would still have to face the strong ideological commitment that both proponents and opponents of privatized corrections seem to hold.",1538-6473,1745-9133,2019,18,2,447,456,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12443,,22/02/2024
294,,Assessing the perceived benefits-criminal offending relationship,"Deterrence theory has been a centerpiece of theoretical and empirical research in criminology. Largely due to the early work of Beccaria however, much of this research has focused on estimating the effect of the certainty of punishment, or the costs of crime, on criminal offending. Although the benefits/rewards of crime are as important as the costs, conceptualization and operationalization of this portion of the decision-making process has only recently accumulated. In an effort to provide a counterpart to the summary statements available regarding the costs of crime, this paper undertakes a statistical summary of the empirical studies that have examined the benefits/offending relationship, with specific attention paid not only to the overall relationship, but also to several key moderators. Using 40 specific estimates from 13 studies since 1990, the analysis provides evidence of a positive and significant relationship between benefits and offending, but that the overall relationship varies in several ways.

Design/methodology/approach The sample used in this study consists of 662 cases of extrafamilial SHs with (n = 145) and without (n = 517) evidence of overkill, respectively. A binomial regression was used to compare at the multivariate level the two groups of crimes, while a latent class analysis was used to determine whether overkill could be associated with different patterns of sexual homicide. Findings Findings from bivariate and logistic regression analyses show that the presence of overkill may be associated with both organized and disorganized sexual homicides. Moreover, latent class analysis suggests that there are three distinct patterns of overkill in sexual homicide: impulsive, sadistic and personal.

However, research specifically investigating decision making in sex offenders' target selection is scarce. The aims of the current study were to (1) identify target selection patterns in a mixed sample of 78 Canadian and Portuguese adult rapists, (2) investigate how geographical decision making influences target selection patterns, and (3) test the influence of the type of environment on target selection patterns. The results indicate that Canadian and Portuguese rapists exhibit different target selection patterns but that their geographical decision making is congruent and consistent with the environment within which they operate.

This article studies area selection and attempts to distinguish between crime generators/visit detractors (elements that could affect anyone) and crime attractors/offense detractors (elements that affect offenders specifically). Methods: Trips that resulted in violent or property crimes between 506 census tracts in a large city (n = 11,411) are analyzed. Multilevel negative binomial regression is used to assess the impact of measures relating to pairs of tracts and characteristics of destination tracts. Results: Various factors are significantly related to the number of crime-associated trips per pair of tracts: differences in reward (residential and visiting population size, presence of schools or bars), differences in effort (distance between tracts, major roads linking both tracts), and differences in risk (level of social disorganization). Conclusions: This article supports an opportunistic perspective on crime: Crime-associated trips are more likely when advantages are high and risks and efforts are low.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2017,54,6,824,846,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427817705935,,22/02/2024

However, environmental choices of serial sex offenders remain unclear to this date. Considering the challenges these offenders pose to law enforcement, the study aims to identify sites serial sex offenders use to encounter and release their victims and investigate their stability across crime series. Methods: The study uses latent class analysis (LCA) to identify victim encounter and release sites used by 72 serial sex offenders having committed 361 sex offenses. Additional LCA are performed to investigate the stability of these offense environments across offenders' crimes series. Results: Distinct profiles of crime sites that are recurrent across crime series are found, suggesting that serial sex offenders present a limited diversity of victim encounter and victim release sites. Encounter sites representative of longer crime series are also identified. Specifically, the use of sites known to attract potential victims decreases over series and offenders become more risk-taking in regard of sites used to encounter their victims. Conclusions: The study identifies patterns of site- selection for the victim encounter and release in cases of serial crimes.

Methods Data are analyzed from randomized experiments and hypothetical vignettes embedded within a nationwide, online survey (n = 1,275). Vignettes were presented for three distinct crime opportunities, drunk driving, fighting, and insurance fraud. Results The findings suggest that respondents adjust two core decision-making perceptions-the perceived certainty of being legally sanctioned and perceived social costs such as stigma or embarrassment-in accord with the content of verbal communications from peers. There is evidence for this both between and within subjects. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of accounting for both physical and social features of the situational context for crime in models of offender decision making.

300,,Beyond legal sanctions: the correlates of self-imposed and socially imposed extralegal risk perceptions,"Research on the formation of sanction risk perceptions has concentrated virtually exclusively on the bases of legal sanction perceptions. This article examines the correlates of extralegal risk perceptions. Theoretical arguments relate previous offending experiences to current perceptions of self-imposed (guilt) and socially imposed (social disapproval) sanctions. The empirical implications of these arguments are tested. Findings indicate that individuals' perceptions of the risk of social disapproval are associated with their own offending experiences, and individuals' perceptions of the risk of guilt are associated with their friends', as well as their own offending experiences. The findings suggest that research on the formation and modification of sanction risk perceptions should not be limited to perceptions of legal sanctions.",0163-9625,1521-0456,2008,29,2,157,190,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01639620701498844,,22/02/2024

303,,Concentrated and Close to Home: The Spatial Clustering and Distance Decay of Lone Terrorist Vehicular Attacks,"Objectives This study examines the spatial characteristics of vehicular terror attacks in Israel from a micro place perspective at the street segment level. Utilizing data obtained from the Israel Security Agency, Israel National police, and open sources, the study analyzes the 71 vehicular attacks carried out in Israel between 2000 and 2017. In addition to examining the hot-spots at which attacks occurred, we also identify hot routes, estimated journey to attack routes. Methods We move beyond traditional approaches by calculating and comparing generalized Gini coefficients and their Lorenz curves for both the hot spots and hot routes. Results Tight spatial clustering in Jerusalem and the West Bank is found to be characteristic of this type of attack, which is limited by a range geographic constraints. Hot routes are identified as being highly concentrated at the street-segment level, although they are relatively less concentrated than hot-spots. Additionally, the presence of a strong distance decay function is confirmed. Conclusions The findings indicate that the laws of crime concentration are applicable to the case of lone terrorist vehicular attacks. The results demonstrate the utility of the methodological approach to examining specific types of terror attacks. Such approaches may be useful for informing environmental based prevention policies and strategies.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2020,36,3,607,645,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-019-09414-z,,22/02/2024
304,,Defiance Theory and Life Course Explanations of Persistent Offending,"Criminologists have long grappled with the varying effect of sanctions. In an effort to clarify these divergent effects, Sherman (1993) delineated a general theory of sanction effects, termed defiance theory. Defiance theory anticipates that there are four necessary conditions for defiance to occur: (a) the sanction must be perceived as unfair; (b) the offender must be poorly bonded; (c) the sanction must be perceived as stigmatizing; and (d) the offender denies the shame produced by the sanction. This study provides one of the first empirical assessments of defiance theory. In addition, defiance theory is examined within the life-course perspective, and analyses address trajectories of offending. Using data from the 1945 Philadelphia Birth Cohort, the results yield promising support for the theory.",0011-1287,1552-387X,2010,56,2,227,252,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0011128707311642,,22/02/2024
305,,Managing Victim Confrontation: Auto Theft and Informal Sanction Threats,"Objectives. This paper explores how offenders manage the prospect of victim confrontation during auto theft. Methods. Data were drawn from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 35 active offenders recruited from the streets of a large Midwestern US city using snowball sampling methods. Results. Two contextual domains figured prominently in the offenders' decision-making calculus: The area around the target and the target itself. The first galvanized the offenders' attention to, and management of, informal social control. The second enjoined offenders to balance speed and stealth in breaching the target. Conclusions. Victim confrontation is an informal sanction that is distinct from both retaliation and traditional extralegal sanctions. The rarity with which it occurs in auto theft is likely due to confrontation avoidance measures offenders adopt at the front end of the offense and during the enactment process itself. The conceptual implications of victim confrontation in crime are explored in relation to the following five areas: (1) sanction celerity and present orientation; (2) sanction certainty and ambiguity aversion; (3) sanction interdependence; (4) violence avoidance; and (5) directions for future research.",0741-8825,1745-9109,2016,33,1,21,44,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2014.891638,,22/02/2024
306,,The Impact of Measurement Error in Regression Models Using Police Recorded Crime Rates,"Objectives Assess the extent to which measurement error in police recorded crime rates impact the estimates of regression models exploring the causes and consequences of crime. Methods We focus on linear models where crime rates are included either as the response or as an explanatory variable, in their original scale or log-transformed. Two measurement error mechanisms are considered, systematic errors in the form of under-recorded crime, and random errors in the form of recording inconsistencies across areas. The extent to which such measurement error mechanisms impact model parameters is demonstrated algebraically using formal notation, and graphically using simulations. Results The impact of measurement error is highly variable across different settings. Depending on the crime type, the spatial resolution, but also where and how police recorded crime rates are introduced in the model, the measurement error induced biases could range from negligible to severe, affecting even estimates from explanatory variables free of measurement error. We also demonstrate how in models where crime rates are introduced as the response variable, the impact of measurement error could be eliminated using log-transformations. Conclusions The validity of a large share of the evidence base exploring the effects and consequences of crime is put into question. In interpreting findings from the literature relying on regression models and police recorded crime rates, we urge researchers to consider the biasing effects shown here. Future studies should also anticipate the impact in their findings and employ sensitivity analysis if the expected measurement error induced bias is non-negligible.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2023,39,4,975,1002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-022-09557-6,Aug-22,22/02/2024
307,,Are deterrent effects contingent on personal morality? The case of shoplifting,"The present article deals with the interplay of personal morality and perceived deterrence in governing shoplifting delinquency. Drawing on key assumptions of Situational Action Theory, we use a crime survey among adolescents from Austria to examine whether the deterrent effect of the perceived certainty of detection when committing shoplifting is contingent on the level of norm acceptance. Our results confirm the expected interactive relationship: Deterrent effects emerge particularly when the moral filter fails to exclude shoplifting from consideration. When social norms are sufficiently internalized, however, no impact of detection risk can be observed. This interplay is consistent with the person-environment-interdependencies emphasized by Situational Action Theory.",0026-9301,2366-1968,2013,96,4,293,313,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mks-2013-960402,,22/02/2024
308,,Is the Effect of Perceived Deterrence on Juvenile Offending Contingent on the Level of Self-Control? Results from Three Countries,"The aim of this paper is to study the interplay of perceived deterrence and level of self-control in explaining individual differences in self-reported offending. Different theories of crime come to different conclusions in this regard. Some postulate independent negative effects of perceived sanction risk on offending (Deterrence Theory), while others assume that low self-control undermines the deterrent effect of legal sanctions (Self-Control Theory) or, conversely, that sanction threats are only relevant for individuals characterized by a lack of self-control (Situational Action Theory). Here, the question of the exact nature of this interplay is addressed from an empirical point of view. Based on three independent surveys of adolescents conducted in three European countries (Austria, Belgium and Slovenia), we examine whether juveniles with low self-control are more, equally or less susceptible to the deterrent effect of legal sanctioning. Our findings consistently support Situational Action Theorys conceptualization of the linkage between self-control and deterrence. All three studies provide evidence that deterrent effects are greatest among adolescents of low self-control.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2014,54,1,128,150,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azt053,,22/02/2024
309,,Should We Stay or Should We Go? A Critical Review of Journey-to-Crime Research,"Our collective understanding of criminal mobility relies almost exclusively on journey-to-crime research, which focuses on the distances traveled by offenders from their homes to the location of their crimes. In this article, we ask whether the theoretical relevance and the methodological validity underlying the journey-to-crime measurement are sufficient for it to continue to be a leading influence in the field of environmental criminology. Based on a critical review of the foundations of journey-to-crime research, we argue that while the interest in the journey-to-crime measurement is understandable, there are better ways to assess criminal mobility. Some likely misleading implicit presuppositions and methodological biases are identified, and the manner in which they affect our comprehension of criminal mobility is discussed. We suggest that a better understanding of criminal mobility would come from complementing journey-to-crime with new and more refined measures. Implications for future studies are proposed.",0882-0783,1936-6469,2023,38,4,914,930,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11896-023-09618-x,Sep-23,22/02/2024

More of than not, arson is expected to increase during periods of economic decline. Over a 12-year period, data on this crime and other demographic variables were collected for 264 counties to study the impact of the 2007 recession on this firesetting.

311,,Differential updating and morality: Is the way offenders learn from police detection associated with their personal morals?,"The majority of differential deterrability research has investigated whether people differ in the extent to which a perceived threat of sanctions deters them from committing a crime. Less is known about the differential influence of criminal justice intervention on sanction threat perceptions. According to deterrence theory, however, for justice intervention to successfully deter crime, a process of perceptual updating is required. In the current study, we used panel data from German adolescents to supplement the research on differential updating. We applied fixed effects regressions to analyze whether people with weaker or stronger morals update their perceptions of detection risk differently following experiences of police detection. Our findings suggest that they do: risk perceptions increased more in adolescents with weak morals than in adolescents with strong morals when they experienced a higher certainty of detection (a higher detection rate). Combined with previous findings on differential deterrence (by personal morality), our results indicate that deterrence processes may-for individuals with weak morals-play a more critical role in the prevention of crime than previous nondifferential research has suggested.",1477-3708,1741-2609,2023,20,3,1061,1080,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14773708221128515,Oct-22,22/02/2024
312,,"INCENTIVES FOR COLLECTIVE DEVIANCE: GROUP SIZE AND CHANGES IN PERCEIVED RISK, COST, AND REWARD","Research has demonstrated that the presence of others shifts decision-making about risky/deviant behavior. One reason for this shift could be changes in the anticipated experience of formal sanctions, informal costs, and rewards. To investigate this possibility, this study conducted two randomized controlled trials with hypothetical vignettes, in which a range of how many other people were also involved in the criminal act defined the treatment conditions. Across two samples of university students (Ns = 396 and 263), the results revealed that as the size of the involved group increased, the anticipated experience of sanction risk and several informal social costs associated with engaging in the act decreased, and the anticipated experience of two rewards increased. Additional analyses suggest that, with one exception in each data set, these changes are not only tied to the solo/group distinction.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2016,54,3,459,486,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12111,,22/02/2024
313,,Consequences of legal risk communication for sanction perception updating and white-collar criminality,"Scholars have long emphasized that communicating, or advertising, information about legal sanction risk is necessary for the success of deterrence-based crime policies. However, scant research has evaluated whether direct communications about legal risk can cause sanction perception updating, the updating of ambiguity in sanction perceptions, or changes in persons' willingness to offend. No prior studies have evaluated sanction perception updating for white-collar crimes. To address this research void, the current study analyzes data from an experiment embedded in a recent national survey (N = 878). Multivariate regression models estimate the effect of providing participants with information about the objective arrest risk for white-collar offenses on their sanction perceptions. The findings provide the first evidence that such information, when it is inconsistent with individuals' prior beliefs, causes them to update: (1) their perceptions of the certainty of arrest; (2) their ambiguity about arrest risk; and, indirectly, (3) their willingness to commit white-collar crimes. The results imply that individuals are willing to incorporate relevant information into their subjective beliefs about sanction risks. Importantly, however, they also make meaningful distinctions about the value of new information for understanding criminal risks.",1573-3750,1572-8315,2016,12,1,75,104,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11292-016-9254-2,,22/02/2024
314,,The Theorizing of Terrorism Within Criminology,"Objectives: While terrorism studies were once castigated as atheoretical and unempirical, criminology has been well suited to apply theories of crime to terrorism and to then test those theories with rigorous methods and robust data. The present study takes stock of how criminologists have theorized about terrorism and tested those theories over time in 13 of the discipline's leading journals. Methods: The study systematically examines theoretical framing, hypotheses, methodological approach, focus within criminology and criminal justice, and policy recommendations in terrorism-focused articles. Results: While terrorism has become more central within top journals, sparse attention has been paid to many criminological theories that could help us understand terrorism. Additional qualitative, theoretical, and mixed-methods research is needed. Further, few articles address the making of terrorism laws. We identify other systematic strengths and weaknesses across the literature and highlight domains for future research. Conclusions: Criminological research on terrorism has engaged theories within and beyond the discipline and employed a range of methodologies with diverse data sources to make contributions to both our broader field and to the larger body of scholarship on terrorism. Yet, many opportunities exist for criminologists to expand research on the making, breaking, and reaction to break laws regarding terrorism.",0022-4278,1552-731X,2023,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00224278231156754,Feb-23,22/02/2024
315,,Evidence on differential deterrability: a narrative review,"Empirical results on the deterrent impact of criminal sanctions are generally disenchanting. Population samples reveal negligible effects of expected sanctioning severity and only modest effects of perceived sanction certainty on measures of criminal activity. Consequently, the concept of differential deterrability - the idea that individuals differ in their responsiveness to sanction threats gains prominence in perceptual deterrence research. The present article provides an overview of the evidence base of differential deterrability. There is indication that individuals who hold weak moral beliefs, possess low self-control and have many delinquent friends are more susceptible to a crime-reducing impact of perceived sanction risk. The observation that those burdened with risk factors for crime are moderately responsive to the risk of legal punishment support a certain suitability of criminal law as instrument of secondary prevention.",0026-9301,2366-1968,2020,103,3,221,233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mks-2020-2051,,22/02/2024
316,,In the shadow of 9/11: How the study of political extremism has reshaped criminology*,"White-collar crime and illegal political extremism share several characteristics with relevance to criminology. Neither is associated with lower socioeconomic status individuals, both involve perpetrators that rarely see themselves as criminal, and both face unique data challenges. Following Edwin Sutherland's influential research, the study of white-collar crime became a recognized specialization within criminology. Similarly, following the coordinated attacks of September 11, 2001, political extremism became increasingly accepted as a legitimate research topic in criminology. I explore several ways that the study of terrorism has influenced criminological research and how responses to terrorist attacks since 9/11 can help us understand policing. Terrorism research has vividly illustrated the socially constructed nature of crime, has encouraged researchers to see not only the deterrence potential of punishment but also its capacity to produce backlash, has accelerated cross-national criminology research, and has hastened the embrace of open sources as an important form of criminal justice data. Changes in policing following 9/11 and the resulting war on terror also provide critical insights into the extent to which policing depends on community trust and legitimacy. As with the embrace of white-collar crime nearly a century ago, mainstream criminology has been enriched by widening its scope to include political extremism.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2022,60,1,5,26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12299,Dec-21,22/02/2024
317,,When Formal Sanctions Encourage Violent Offending: How Violent Peers and Violent Codes Undermine Deterrence,"Research focusing on deterrence has stressed the negative relationship between perceived formal sanctions and criminal behavior, ignoring the possibility that in some populations formal sanctions may serve to increase offending under some conditions. Utilizing a sample of 300 homeless street youths, the study explores if violent peers, violent values, and the culture of the street moderates the association between perceived legal sanctions and violent offending. The results suggest that violent peers, violent values, and the culture of the street condition the perceived certainty of punishment so that it leads to higher levels of violence. Further, the culture of the street conditions the relationship between perceived severity of punishment and violence.

318,,THE INTERPLAY OF MORAL NORMS AND INSTRUMENTAL INCENTIVES IN CRIME CAUSATION*,"Rational choice theories (RCTs) of crime assume actors behave in an instrumental, outcome-oriented way. Accordingly, individuals should weight the costs and benefits of criminal acts with subjective probabilities that these outcomes will occur. Previous studies either do not directly test this central hypothesis or else yield inconsistent results. We show that a meaningful test can be conducted only if a broader view is adopted that takes into account the interplay of moral norms and instrumental incentives. Such a view can be derived from the Model of Frame Selection (Kroneberg, 2005) and the Situational Action Theory of Crime Causation (Wikstrom, 2004). Based on these theories, we analyze the willingness to engage in shoplifting and tax fraud in a sample of 2,130 adults from Dresden, Germany. In line with our theoretical expectations, we find that only respondents who do not feel bound by moral norms show the kind of instrumental rationality assumed in RCTs of crime. Where norms have been strongly internalized, and in the absence of neutralizations, instrumental incentives are irrelevant.",0011-1384,1745-9125,2010,48,1,259,294,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00187.x,,22/02/2024
319,,"Sanctions, Perceptions, and Crime","The interplay of sanctions, perceptions, and crime has special significance in criminology and is central to a long tradition of perceptual deterrence research as well as to more recent scholarship on crime decision-making. This article seeks to review this body of research as it pertains to three basic questions. First, are people's perceptions of punishment accurate? The evidence indicates that people are generally but imperfectly aware of punishments allowed under the law but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in enforcement, especially of behaviors that are personally relevant. Second, does potential apprehension affect people's perceived risk and behavior when faced with a criminal opportunity? A highly varied body of literature supports the conclusion that perceptions are sensitive to situational cues and that behavior is sensitive to perceived risk, but these links can be weakened when individuals are in emotionally or socially charged situations. Third, do people revise their risk perceptions in response to crime and punishment experiences? Studies of perceptual change support the contention that people systematically update their perceptions based on their own and others' experiences with crime and punishment.",2572-4568,,2022,5,,205,227,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-criminol-030920-112932,,22/02/2024
320,,A test of the predictive validity of hypothetical intentions to offend,"Researchers commonly use hypothetical intentions to offend as proxies for real-world offending behavior. The current study examined the predictive validity of these hypothetical intentions, as well as the consequences of using offending intentions in statistical models of decision-making. Undergraduate students were asked to self-report their intentions to cheat on a hypothetical online exam for which they were unprepared. Minutes later, they completed a difficult online trivia test for course credit. Students who performed well on the trivia test were presumed to have cheated. Hypothetical intentions to cheat were found to predict actual cheating at a rate no better than chance. Furthermore, while several factors were found to be predictive of hypothetical cheating, none were predictive of actual cheating. This incongruence between intentions and behavior may be attributed to the different emotional reactions evoked by hypothetical and real-world offending opportunities. Implications for research on offender decision-making are discussed.",0735-648X,2158-9119,2018,41,2,136,154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.2016.1244486,,22/02/2024
321,,"Morality, Deterrability, and Offender Decision Making","Deterrence describes a process in which perceived risks and rewards influence offending decisions, whereas deterrability refers to the capacity or inclination to engage in this process. There are alternative forms of undeterrability. Incorrigible individuals offend regardless of how high the potential legal costs are and acute conformists refrain from crime regardless of how low the potential legal costs are. Using data from a nationwide survey of Americans (n = 955), the current study distinguishes two manifestations of morality hypothesized to underlie acute conformity. Results suggest that people's moral identity, which reflects their degree of commitment to ethical and prosocial ideals, informs their specific moral attitudes, or appraisals of the wrongfulness of particular behaviors. These constructs operate in tandem to produce acute conformity. Additionally, moral attitudes are found to vary by behavior resulting in within person heterogeneity in the acute conformity characterization. We discuss our findings as it relates to theoretical advancement of deterrability and policy that promotes conformity.",0741-8825,1745-9109,2022,39,1,1,25,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2019.1709884,Jan-20,22/02/2024
322,,"Sanctions, Perceptions, and Crime: Implications for Criminal Deterrence","A survey of empirical research concerning the determinants of an individual's perceptions of the risk of formal sanctions as a consequence of criminal behavior. The specific questions considered are: (1) How accurate is people's knowledge about criminal sanctions? (2) How do people acquire and modify their subjective probabilities of punishment risk? (3) How do individuals act on their risk perceptions in specific criminal contexts? Three broad classes of extant studies are reviewed. The first is the relationship between objective sanctions, sanction enforcement, and risk perceptions-research that includes calibration studies and correlational studies. The second is the relationship between punishment experiences (personal and vicarious) and change in risk perceptions, in particular, research that relies on formal models of Bayesian learning. The third is the responsiveness of would-be offenders to immediate environmental cues-a varied empirical tradition that encompasses vignette research, offender interviews, process tracing, and laboratory studies. First, research concerning the accuracy of risk perceptions suggests that the average citizen does a reasonable job of knowing what criminal penalties are statutorily allowed, but does a quite poor job of estimating the probability and magnitude of the penalties. On the other hand, studies which inquire about more common offenses (alcohol and marijuana use) from more crime-prone populations (young people, offenders) reveal that perceptions are consistently better calibrated to actual punishments. Second, research on perceptual updating indicates that personal experiences and, to a lesser degree, vicarious experiences with crime and punishment are salient determinants of changes in risk perceptions. Specifically, individuals who commit crime and successfully avoid arrest tend to lower their subjective probability of apprehension. Third, research on the situational context of crime decision making reveals that risk perceptions are highly malleable to proximal influences which include, but are not limited to, objective sanction risk. Situational risk perceptions appear to be particularly strongly influenced by substance use, peer presence, and arousal level. The perceptual deterrence tradition is theoretically rich, and has been renewed in the last decade by creative empirical tests from a variety of social scientific disciplines. Many knowledge gaps and limitations remain, and ensuing research should assign high priority to such considerations as sampling strategies and the measurement of risk perceptions.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2013,29,1,67,101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-012-9170-1,,22/02/2024

We test whether there is racial variation in this strain-coping mechanism-antisocial behavior relationship. We document a relationship between perceived school fairness and adult support on fighting among racial minorities but not White students. Among White students, stronger perceptions of school fairness are associated with reduced probabilities of fighting regardless of social support.

Despite a growing number of studies using this perspective, very few have investigated sexual offences specifically. The current study uses police event data to investigate the spatial distribution of sexual offences from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, in the city of Austin, Texas (N=1381). After disaggregating offences, first by victim age (child versus adult) and then by type of sexual act (penetration, sexual contact, and sexual non-contact), three measures of spatial clustering, kernel density analyses, and a spatial point pattern test were used. Findings indicate that sexual offences perpetrated against children and adults were spatially concentrated but the degree to which they clustered depended on the type of sexual act committed. Spatial point pattern findings suggest that the street segments (and intersections) affected by sexual crime differed according to the nature of the sexual act committed.

325,,Hot spots of mental health crises: A look at the concentration of mental health calls and future directions for policing,"Purpose A strong body of research has established the concentration of crime in a small number of street segments or hot spots throughout urban cities, but the spatial distribution of mental health-related calls for services is less well known. The extent to which these calls are concentrated on a small number of street segments, similar to traditional crime calls for service is understudied. The purpose of this paper is to examine the concentration of mental health calls and the spatial distribution of street segments with mental health calls to provide directions for law enforcement and place-based policing. Design/methodology/approach Using call for service data from a large city on the East coast, the current study examines whether mental health calls for service are concentrated on street segments, and tests spatial dispersion to whether these mental health hot spots are spread throughout the city or clustered in space. Finally, the authors explore the relationship between mental health calls and violent and drug calls by calculating the correlation and using a spatial point pattern test to determine if mental health calls are spatially similar to violent and drug calls. Findings The authors found that mental health calls are concentrated on street segments; specifically 22.4 percent of calls are located on 0.5 percent of city street segments. Additionally, these street segments are fairly dispersed throughout the city. When comparing the spatial similarity of mental health calls to violent and drug calls, they are highly correlated suggesting a relationship between the calls types, but the location of mental health calls appears to be different from violet and drug calls. Originality/value Very few studies have examined the location of mental health calls and whether they are concentrated in small areas similar to crime, but such research can provide police officers new approaches to working with people with mental health problems. The police are the primary emergency response for calls involving someone with a mental illness or experiencing a mental health crisis and the authors provide suggestions for policing that draw from strategies used in hot spot policing and mental health responses, like CIT, to address challenges of modern policing and working with people with mental health problems.",1363-951X,1758-695X,2018,41,3,401,414,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2017-0155,,22/02/2024

A comparative analysis of delinquent behaviors in the City of Guangzhou, China","The social impact of rural-to-urban migration in China has grasped domestic and international attention over the past decades. Sociological scholarship indicates that this working class may be subject to social stigma and additional psychological stress. As new generations emerge, the migrant workers' children are publicized to engage in higher level of delinquency and deviant behavior in large Chinese cities. However, this understanding is supported by little empirical evidence as few studies focus on the delinquent behaviors of rural migrant children compared to their urban counterparts. The current study explores this comparison using a high school student survey (N = 1,490) conducted in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. Important contributing factors to the prevalence and variety of self-report delinquency are discussed in the multi-theory framework. Findings suggest that this sample of rural migrant students are exposed to more risks but are not more delinquency-prone than non-migrant students; results show support to quite different socialization processes for the two groups: strong moral beliefs and good academic performance play key roles in the prevention of delinquency for rural migrant students while non-rural migrants are affected by school attachment and negative social activities.

327,,Research on Terrorism and Countering Terrorism,"Social and behavioral research on terrorism has expanded dramatically. However, theoretical work that incorporates terrorism and collection of valid data on it has lagged behind theoretical work on other criminological subjects. Theorizing has been dominated by deterrence perspectives. Threats of severe consequence for terrorist acts in general show little promise, but there is evidence that increasing the certainty of consequences works in some situations. Research on terrorism will be improved if it moves beyond deterrence to include concepts drawn from legitimacy, strain, and situational perspectives. Limitations of traditional criminology data sources for studying terrorism have encouraged the development of open-source-event databases. The most comprehensive, created by combining the Global Terrorism Database with RAND-MIPT data, documents more than 77,000 terrorist incidents from 1970 to 2006. Attacks peaked in the early 1990s and then declined substantially until 9/11. They have since substantially increased. The regional concentration of terrorism has moved from Western Europe in the 1970s, to Latin America in the 1980s, to the Middle East and Persian Gulf in the twenty-first century.

328,,Confidence in the criminal justice system: Differences between citizens and criminal justice officials in China,"This article examines citizens' confidence in the Chinese criminal justice system, with data from the surveys collected in three provincial capitals with a random sampling strategy in 2007 and 2008. Multivariate analyses are conducted, and follow-up questions are explored with a comparative approach to assess the differences between public perceptions and the views of criminal justice officials within the current social context. The sample sizes for citizens and officials were 217 and 90, respectively. Findings show that the majority of citizens and officials believed that there was a lack of confidence in the Chinese criminal justice system, as demonstrated in the recent 'anger-venting' events. This finding is inconsistent with the limited empirical literature on public attitudes in China. The important factors such as perceptions of fairness, corruption and extortion of confessions are explored, and policy implications are discussed.",1748-8958,1748-8966,2014,14,4,503,524,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1748895813505233,,22/02/2024
329,,Visitor Inflows and Police Use of Force in a Canadian City,"Early ethnographic studies suggested that police intervention should be understood within its larger context. Still, the number of studies focused on the ecology of force remains small compared to those of studies on individual and situational factors. Furthermore, Canada remains nearly absent from the academic literature on police use of force. Assuming that force does not occur in a spatially random manner, this article aims to test propositions for the main macrosociological perspectives in the use-of-force literature: social disorganization theory, the minority-threat hypothesis, and the theory of police rigour. Another purpose of this study is to investigate whether, at the level of the census tract (CT), visitor inflows are predictive of police action. Negative binomial regression modelling is used to predict the occurrence of 1,411 self-reported uses of force in 506 CTs. The findings show that social disorganization is the most predictive explanation for the frequency of use-of-force situations in an area. The analysis also supports the proposition that the frequency of use-of-force situations is positively related to the level of crime in the area. While the inclusion of visitor inflows significantly improves the analysis of spatial variations of police use of force, it contributes relatively little relative to other explanations. No support was found for the minority threat hypothesis, nor for Klinger's theory of police vigour.",1707-7753,1911-0219,2017,59,3,373,396,http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/cjccj.2016.0016.R1,,22/02/2024
330,,Exploratory Space-Time Analysis of Burglary Patterns,"This paper introduces two new methods for the exploratory analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of residential burglary patterns. The first is a conditional spatial Markov chain which considers the extent to which a location's probability of experiencing a residential burglary in a future period is related to the prevalence of residential burglaries in its surrounding neighborhood in an initial period. The second measure extends this conditional perspective to examine the joint evolution of residential burglary in a location and its surrounding neighborhood. These methods are applied to a case study of residential burglary patterns in Mesa, Arizona over the period October 2005 through December 2009. Strong patterns of spatial clustering of burglary activity are present in each year, and this clustering is found to have an important influence on both the conditional and joint evolution of burglary activity across space and time.",0748-4518,1573-7799,2012,28,3,509,531,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10940-011-9151-9,,22/02/2024

332,,Invasion of the 'body snatchers':: Burglary reconsidered,"The victim of crime has become the focus of increasing concern in recent years, particularly in the context of the impact crime has on its victims. This article takes a novel approach within this debate contending that the conceptualization of victimization remains underdeveloped with respect to the experience of crime for victims. In particular, this article explores elements of threat to or loss of property and physical safety that impinge on personal and communal well-being. Further, we draw together perspectives on 'well-being' that focus on the boundaries of body, home and personal space as key constituents of a sense of both identity and safety. We argue for a richer conceptualization of victimization developing existing approaches with discussions of fear, embodiment and personal/spatial 'privacy'.",1362-4806,1461-7439,2000,4,4,451,472,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1362480600004004003,,22/02/2024

334,,"Watering the Plant in Another's Courtyard: An Ethnographic Exploration of Daughters' Devaluation Through Sex-Selected Abortions Among the Rural Married Females in South Punjab, Pakistan","The current study sets forth the cultural underpinnings for daughters' devaluation over son preferences in South Punjab, Pakistan. The major purpose of the present study was to provide an accurate description of women's attitude on different aspects of sex-selected abortions (SSAs). Women, with a rural background, either forced to devalue their female fetus clinically or based on violence, were the targeted participants. Using ethnographic exploration with 161 obtrusive observations, 37 in-depth interviews, and 10 focus group discussions (FGD), comprising of 85 narrated case studies, the attitudes of rural married females toward daughters' devaluation through SSAs were recorded. The findings of study allied the autonomy paradigm with a feminist perspective through argumentation of the lack of women's individual identity in the domestic sphere. In addition, sociocultural legitimization toward patriarchal regimes snatches women's autonomy over their reproductive behavior. Resultantly, daughters' devaluation is analogous to sons' preference, which arose through women's subservience and exposure to violence in the intricate cultural web. Using ethnographic exploration through various anthropological research techniques, it explicates the nuanced feminist regimes for understanding women's reproductive choice and empowerment. In conclusion, women's subordination is the cause of differential power relations and inadequate gender inequality which results in SSAs. The current study exposed gender-biased power discrimination that consequently affects the women's autonomous decision making about their reproductive behavior. Similarly, it highlighted how husband and in-laws (especially mother-in-law) used illegal medicines, dietary practices, traditional methods, or new biotechnological methods to execute the illegal act of SSA. This study may serve as the basic legal framework to check the deep-rooted culture of violence against vulnerable segments of the population.",0886-2605,1552-6518,2021,36,09-Oct,4490,4519,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260518791598,,22/02/2024
335,,Toward a test of the Law of Crime Concentration in Japanese cities: a geographical crime analysis in Tokyo and Osaka,"This brief report aims to reveal crime concentration at the district level in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, two cities characterized by low crime rates. Eight types of property crimes that occurred between 2008 and 2017 in Tokyo and Osaka and had been aggregated by the census enumeration district were analyzed using the Gini coefficient based on the Poisson-Gamma method. The results indicated three patterns. First, crime concentration was identified. Second, the degree of concentration depended upon crime type. Commercial burglary was the most concentrated crime type, and theft from vehicle and theft from vending machine were the most dispersed. Third, crime concentration patterns either remained stable or became more concentrated over time. Additionally, while theft of bicycle was found to display stable concentration levels over time, the concentration level of purse snatching was fluid. On the basis of the results, this report discusses the possibility of establishing the Law of Crime Concentration (LCC) in two Japanese cities.",,2193-7680,2019,8,1,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40163-019-0106-z,,22/02/2024
336,,Authoritarian policing with Chinese characteristics: A case study of motorcycle bans in the Pearl River Delta,"Despite unprecedented economic and social changes over the past three decades, China remains an authoritarian regime. However, the current authoritarian regime differs in many ways from that under Mao. Since the nature of a police force reflects the character of the political regime within which it operates, this paper explores current police practices in China. It argues that policing in China is neither completely authoritarian nor democratic, but best understood as soft-authoritarian. The case study examines policing of a motorcycle ban that was implemented to prevent motorcycle snatch theft in the Pearl River Delta. The police remained authoritarian and used many coercive strategies to push for the motorcycle ban. However, their hard-line strategies were matched by some soft-line persuasive tactics. I argue that changing state-society relations are leading to resistance to hard-authoritarian policing and contributing to soft-authoritarian policing in China.",0925-4994,1573-0751,2014,61,4,439,460,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10611-013-9495-1,,22/02/2024
337,,Advancement of Criminal Profiling Methods in Faceted Multidimensional Analysis,"The current study seeks to advance the faceted multidimensional scaling (termed FMDS) procedure used in much of the investigative psychology research. To this end, recent research on street robbery by Goodwill and colleagues will be utilised to illustrate the effectiveness of a facet scale method for offender profiling. Four FMDS themes of street robbery (Con, Blitz, Confrontation and Snatch) were revealed by the crossing of two underlying axial facets: the offenders' level of violence and interaction with the victim. The facet scale method, utilising offenders' axial facet scores, was compared to previous count, proportional and centroid classification methods in the prediction of offender criminal histories. Utilising logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, the axial facet scale method was found to significantly outperform the qualitatively based dominant theme classification methods that typically employ angular and radial facets for FMDS interpretation. Implications for the use of axial facet scales within FMDS analysis for offender profiling research are discussed.

338,,Drive-Away Policing and Situational Crime Prevention in China: An Analysis of Motorcycle Ban (jinmo) Policy in Guangzhou,"Using the example of motorcycle ban policy in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, this article examines how situational crime prevention strategies are used in contemporary urban China. The article argues that although a motorcycle ban policy may reduce motorcycle snatch theft (feiche qiangduo) in Guangzhou, it inevitably caused a problem of displacement. However, some types of displacement are desirable for local government. An argument about drive-away policing is proposed in this article to understand policing styles in contemporary China. In addition, the article argues that motorcycle ban, as a strategy to prevent snatch theft and robbery, is also a strategy to deal with the crisis in police legitimacy. Therefore, crime prevention in China has more social and political significance than just reducing crime.",0306-624X,1552-6933,2012,56,2,239,264,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624X10395715,,22/02/2024
339,,Multidimensional Latent Classification of Street Robbery' Offences,"In a recent study of personal robbery, commissioned by the Home Office in the UK, a qualitative typology of robbery offences was proposed based on the approach used by the offender to commit the crime, consisting of four approach types: Blitz, Confrontation, Con, and Snatch. Conceptual inspection of the typology reveals that these proposed types may be hypothetically demarcated as the product of two latent dimensions: interaction (between the offender and the victim) and violence (used to threaten/harm the victim). The current paper utilises crime scene information from 72 incarcerated male offenders convicted of street robbery to test this hypothesis. Convergent statistical analysis was utilised to test the structure of Smith's typology first using multidimensional scaling (MDS) and then principal component analysis (PCA). MDS and PCA analyses provided convergent support for the existence of the four robbery styles and the latent dimensions of interaction and violence. Implications of Smith's typological structure and latent behavioural dimensions on the conceptualisation and classification of robbery offences are discussed within the existing literature on street robbery.

340,,A Position of Influence: Variation in Offender Identification Rates by Location in a Lineup,"Researchers have identified several threats to the validity of the use of the lineup as a test of true recognition. One concern is related to the structure of the simultaneous lineup. It is argued here that a simultaneous presentation of an array nonetheless requires the viewer to undertake sequential processing of the items in the array. This sequential pattern is unlikely to be random and therefore the position of a culprit in a lineup may have a significant effect on the accuracy of witness selection. A simulated crime (snatching of a handbag) was shown to a convenience sample of 84 undergraduates aged between 18-23 years. In 84 subsequent live lineups, the offender was placed with four foils. He was positioned on the far left (position 1) in 42 cases (50%), and in 14 cases respectively in positions 3 (centre), 4 (centre right) and 5 (extreme right). A very strong association was found between position and correct identification with position 1 placement leading to a significantly lower proportion of correct identification (7.1%) compared to position 3 (50.0%), position 4 (64.3%), and position 5 (21.4%). Steps to remedy possible positional biases are considered. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1544-4759,,2009,6,2,139,149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jip.102,,22/02/2024
341,,"The links between heroin, crack cocaine and crime - Where does street crime fit in?","There has been a wealth of research into the links between heroin, crack cocaine and the committal of crime in general. However, there has been much less research into the links between heroin, crack cocaine and the committal of street crimes. In this paper, I draw on my own research evidence to examine the nature of these links and find that heroin and crack cocaine use was not a direct cause of 'petty crime' such as shoplifting. This is because the onset of participation in petty crimes, such as shoplifting, tends to precede induction into drug use. However, I also find that regular use of heroin and crack cocaine eventually led, and was thus apparently related, to street robbery and snatch theft. I qualify this latter finding by showing how and why street crimes were one-off 'acts of desperation'.",0007-0955,1464-3529,2005,45,3,355,372,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azi001,,22/02/2024
342,,Seasonality of property crime in Hong Kong,Rates of property crime (burglary and theft) in Hong Kong for the period 1991-2000 were analysed to determine their relationships with seasons. Regression analysis (using dummy variables) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed to test the existence of seasonality. A dummy variable regression model was used to examine whether property crime rates varied more in some months than others. Results indicated the absence of seasonality in burglary and total theft. Shop theft had a winter peak and snatching and pickpocketing had a weak summer crest. The Hong Kong experience is different from that of other regions and this present study acts as a cross-cultural perspective to the topic of crime seasonality.,0007-0955,,2004,44,2,276,283,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/44.2.276,,22/02/2024
