# Quick Reference: Key Changes Required

## TERMINOLOGY CHANGES
**Replace everywhere**:
- "aesthetic quality" → "aesthetic complexity" or "graffiti form"
- "quality hierarchy" → "complexity spectrum" 
- "low/medium/high quality" → "simple/moderate/complex forms"
- "aesthetic competition" → "site suitability and risk calibration"
- "writers compete for status" → "writers select appropriate sites"

## CRITICAL CITATIONS TO ADD
**Essential graffiti culture sources**:
- Chastanet, F. (2007) - on tag artistry
- Baldini, M. (2008) - on graffiti subcultural values
- Chamberlain, R. et al. (2022) - on graffiti aesthetics
- Hannerz, E. (2023) - on spot theory development
- Fransberg & Vasileva (2025) - on subcultural gaze
- Macdonald, N. (2001) - on gendered perspectives
- Pabón-Colón, J. - on feminist graffiti research

## REQUIRED ANALYSES
1. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Re-run MHI excluding stencils
2. **Visual Documentation**: Add photos of each category
3. **Local Context**: Research Ghent graffiti policies
4. **Alternative Results**: Present both original and refined categorizations

## HYPOTHESIS REVISION
**Original**: "Competition for aesthetic status leads to clustering by quality"
**Revised**: "Differential site requirements and risk tolerances lead to clustering by graffiti form complexity"

## KEY ACKNOWLEDGMENTS NEEDED
1. **Community Engagement**: "Most significant limitation - lack of practitioner input"
2. **Cultural Misrepresentation Risk**: "Visual categorization without subcultural validation"
3. **Alternative Explanations**: "Risk calibration likely primary mechanism"
4. **Geographic Specificity**: "Single-city study in specific policy context"

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS REVISION
**Avoid**: Prescriptive recommendations about managing "quality"
**Include**: Suggestions for understanding functional differences and community needs

## WRITING TONE CHANGES
- More humble about motivational claims
- Less definitive about cultural interpretations  
- More tentative about causal mechanisms
- More respectful of subcultural knowledge

## STRUCTURE PRIORITIES
1. **Front-load limitations** (don't hide them at the end)
2. **Lead with site suitability** in discussion
3. **Present aesthetic factors as secondary**
4. **Emphasize empirical pattern over interpretation**

This quick reference should help you stay consistent while implementing the major revisions across all sections of your manuscript.
