They also prefer areas with higher population turnover and social heterogeneity.",Dependency in data due to reoffending could lead to errors in statistical inference.,"Study extends external validity by examining a new crime type and location, but exclusion of external crimes and focus on TFV may limit generalizability.","Findings specific to TFV in Dorset, UK; may not apply to other crimes or locations.",The study suggests using smaller spatial units like Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) for analysis.
The Importance of Importance Sampling,2009-2018,"Not explicitly mentioned, but implied to be during the study period",New Zealand,National,Not explicitly given,Non-residential burglary and sexual offenses,Random samples of 50% of the offenders within each offense type,NA,Cross-sectional,Conditional logit,"Presence of activity nodes near potential crime locations, number of households in an area for residential burglary.",Presence of activity nodes increases choice probability.,Results may only generalize to identified offenders; data from solved cases may not represent all offenders.,"The findings may only apply to offenders who have been identified and proceeded against, and are limited by a single data source and country.",The findings are specific to the New Zealand context.,Use larger datasets with more variables and granular spatial units.
THE INFLUENCE OF ACTIVITY SPACE AND VISITING FREQUENCY ON CRIME LOCATION CHOICE: FINDINGS FROM AN ONLINE SELF-REPORT SURVEY,2013-2016,"May, June, and September 2016",Netherlands,Not specified (entire country),Not explicitly given (median neighbourhood size: 0.68 km²),"Multiple types (violent offences, thefts, vandalism, etc.)",140 offences,140,Cross-sectional,Conditional logit,Presence of any activity node and frequency of visits to these nodes.,Probability of targeting an area increases with presence of an activity node and frequency of visits.,Accuracy of reported information not always certain; difficulties in remembering details.,Limited to young adults and those known to the police; findings may not apply to all offenders.,Findings specific to young adult offenders in urban areas in the western part of the Netherlands.,The study suggests using more detailed spatial units to capture awareness spaces and travel paths.
