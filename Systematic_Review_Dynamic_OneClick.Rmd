# Abstract

**Background:** Spatial unit selection plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of crime location choice. Choosing an appropriate spatial scale is important because different units can lead to substantially different conclusions about offender decision-making, environmental context, and the effectiveness of place-based interventions. In this study, we examine spatial-unit selection practices to assess whether these decisions reflect the underlying theoretical alignment or stem from practical and methodological considerations.

**Methods:** We conducted a narrative review that involved searching four databases and identifying `r format(analysis$total_records_identified, big.mark = ",")` papers. After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, we screened `r analysis$records_reviewed` papers in full and retained `r analysis$studies_included` studies representing `r analysis$n_studies` observations. We then examined spatial-unit selection practices, variable complexity, and data limitations through descriptive analysis and mixed-effects regression models.

**Results:** Studies demonstrated sophisticated variable usage, incorporating `r analysis$min_variables`-`r analysis$max_variables` variables (mean: `r round(analysis$mean_variables, 1)`) across multiple domains. Spatial unit sizes span `r analysis$orders_magnitude` orders of magnitude from individual properties to administrative districts, reflecting systematic scale-matching to different criminological processes. Despite technological advances, spatial unit sizes remained stable over time (*β* = `r analysis$year_beta`, *p* = `r analysis$year_p`), with strong country-level clustering (ICC = `r analysis$icc`) suggesting that national data infrastructures and established research conventions exert a stronger influence on scale selection than recent technological advances.

**Conclusions:** Our review indicates that crime-location-choice research generally employs spatial scales thoughtfully, aligning them with theoretical aims while working within institutional and data constraints. Rather than reflecting arbitrary choices, the observed variation appears to stem from deliberate, context-sensitive decisions. Strengthening data infrastructures and promoting standardization across jurisdictions may further enhance the comparability and cumulative value of future studies.

# Introduction

Crime concentrates in specific locations, creating spatial patterns that researchers analyze using discrete choice models to understand offender location selection [@bernasco2013; @vandeviver2015]. These models conceptualize crime location selection as rational decision-making where offenders evaluate potential targets based on expected costs and benefits. Recent empirical studies demonstrate remarkable scale diversity: Vandeviver et al. [-@vandeviver2015] analyzed 503,589 individual residential properties (136 m² average) in Belgium, while Bernasco et al. [-@bernasco2013] examined 24,594 census blocks (19,680 m² average) for street robbery in Chicago. This scale variation spans nearly three orders of magnitude, raising fundamental questions about methodological coherence in spatial criminology. Bernasco and Jacques [-@bernasco2015] demonstrated that drug dealers systematically choose locations that optimize expected rewards while minimizing costs, establishing this framework for consensual crimes. However, a fundamental methodological decision underlies all crime location choice studies yet receives minimal systematic attention: selecting the spatial unit of analysis.

Spatial unit selection defines the geographical scale at which researchers model crime location decisions. Studies analyze individual properties, street segments, neighborhoods, or administrative districts, with current evidence revealing extraordinary diversity in scale choices. Our analysis reveals spatial units ranging from 136 m² residential properties to 12 km² regional districts—a scale variation spanning nearly five orders of magnitude across contemporary studies. This methodological choice directly affects statistical power, result interpretation, and policy relevance [@fotheringham1991; @openshaw1984]. Despite its fundamental importance, crime location choice research lacks systematic guidelines for spatial unit selection decisions, leading to concerns about methodological coherence and cumulative knowledge building.

This study examines how researchers actually select spatial units across different empirical contexts. Current practice appears systematically informed rather than purely pragmatic—our evidence reveals that researchers provide explicit theoretical justification for spatial scale selection in `r analysis$rationale_coverage`% of cases, contradicting assumptions about arbitrary methodological choices. However, these justifications cluster around distinct rationale categories: data availability constraints (`r analysis$data_availability_pct`%), theory-method alignment (`r analysis$theory_method_pct`%), prior research integration (`r analysis$prior_research_pct`%), and practical considerations (`r analysis$practical_constraints_pct`%). This systematic distribution suggests organized approaches to navigating theoretical requirements and institutional constraints, challenging characterizations of methodological chaos while revealing the complex factors that shape analytical possibilities in spatial criminology.

## Theoretical Background

Crime location choice research has undergone fundamental transformation in spatial scale over the past several decades. Early criminological research focused predominantly on large spatial units such as cities, states, and neighborhoods, examining broad patterns of crime distribution across administrative boundaries. This macro-level approach provided valuable insights into regional crime patterns but offered limited understanding of micro-spatial decision-making processes underlying individual offending events.

The evolution toward micro-level analysis represents a paradigm shift driven by theoretical advances and technological capabilities. Micro-place analysis marked a major transition, focusing on specific locations like street segments, census blocks, and grid cells [@eck1995; @weisburd2004]. This shift fundamentally changed how researchers conceptualize crime location choice, enabling examination of offender decision-making at scales where these decisions actually occur [@bernasco2019; @bernasco2013; @bernasco2015].

Contemporary studies demonstrate sophisticated theoretical alignment between spatial scale and criminological processes. Property-level studies use house-level units because "the use of fine-grained spatial units of analysis such as the house that is burglarized has the advantage that it addresses the modifiable areal unit problem and reduces the risk of aggregation bias" [@vandeviver2015]. Street segment analyses recognize that "the spatial resolution of a street segment naturally corresponds to human observational limitations" and "possesses attributes suitable for direct sensory perception" [@kuralarasan2024]. These examples illustrate how spatial unit selection reflects theoretically-informed decisions rather than arbitrary methodological choices.

Spatial unit selection connects to fundamental issues in spatial analysis and criminology. The modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) demonstrates that statistical relationships change significantly depending on spatial scale [@fotheringham1991]. In crime research, environmental factors relate to crime differently at different scales [@weisburd2012], creating challenges for theory development and policy application.

Crime pattern theory suggests that offender decision-making operates across multiple spatial scales—from immediate target characteristics to broader activity spaces where offenders spend their time [@brantingham1993]. Different mechanisms may dominate at different scales, making spatial unit selection a theoretically consequential choice rather than a purely methodological decision. Fine-grained analyses capture target-specific characteristics and immediate environmental features, while broader scales better represent neighborhood-level social processes and routine activity patterns.

Routine activity theory implies scale-dependent effects in how motivated offenders, suitable targets, and absence of guardians converge [@cohen1979]. The spatial scale of analysis determines which aspects of this convergence become visible and measurable, influencing both theoretical understanding and practical applications for crime prevention.

## Methodological Considerations

Spatial choice model statistical properties depend critically on spatial scale. Model performance typically increases with finer resolution due to greater variation among alternatives [@train2009]. However, finer scales may introduce noise and reduce parameter stability.

Computational constraints become important with fine-grained units. The number of potential alternatives grows exponentially with spatial resolution, creating computational challenges that researchers must navigate when selecting spatial scales. This practical constraint may drive researchers toward coarser spatial units regardless of theoretical preferences. For example, Smith and Brown [-@smith2007] divided Richmond, Virginia into 4,895 grid cells (0.032 km² each) acknowledging computational constraints while maintaining fine spatial resolution. Hanayama et al. [-@hanayama2018] employed 1,134 grid cells (25,000 m² average) for burglary analysis, explicitly balancing computational feasibility with analytical precision. Conversely, studies analyzing very large choice sets face memory limitations: Vandeviver et al. [-@vandeviver2015] analyzed over 500,000 potential targets, requiring specialized computational approaches to handle such extensive alternative sets.

Data availability represents another key constraint. Administrative data often dictate available spatial units, with crime data typically aggregated to police districts or census units. High-resolution data may be available in some jurisdictions but not others, creating systematic biases in methodological choices across contexts. Our evidence reveals substantial jurisdictional clustering: Netherlands contributes `r analysis$netherlands_pct`% of studies despite representing a small fraction of global research infrastructure, while entire continents remain underrepresented. Bernasco et al. [-@bernasco2013] found that data limitations prevented tracking offenders across multiple crimes, illustrating how institutional data systems fundamentally shape analytical possibilities regardless of theoretical preferences. Studies continue to face computational constraints even with modern technology, as memory limitations force sampling decisions that affect methodological choices. Administrative boundary availability varies systematically across jurisdictions: Baudains et al. [-@baudains2013] used Lower Super Output Areas (0.33 km² average) readily available in UK administrative systems, while Chinese studies like Long et al. [-@long2021] employ community units (1.62 km² average) that align with local administrative structures but differ substantially in scale and definition from Western equivalents.

Contemporary studies reveal extensive data constraints that shape methodological decisions. Property-level studies using Google Street View acknowledge that "the inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a biased sample, as these cannot be coded" [@langton2017]. Registry data limitations force analytic restrictions, as "registry data lacks information on apartments, limiting analyses to house burglaries" [@vandeviver2015]. These constraints demonstrate how data infrastructure fundamentally shapes spatial unit selection beyond theoretical considerations. Studies employing street segment analysis face limitations where "street segments are still too coarse as units of analysis, not only because they still cover too large territory but also because their relevant characteristics are not stable over time" [@bernasco2015].

# Research Questions

**RQ1**: What is the distribution of spatial unit sizes used in crime location choice studies?

**RQ2**: Have spatial unit sizes changed over time as computational capabilities and data availability improved?

**RQ3**: Do spatial unit choices differ systematically across jurisdictions, particularly between Anglo-Saxon and other legal traditions?

**RQ4**: Are certain crime types associated with particular spatial scales?

**RQ5**: How do researchers explain their spatial unit selection decisions, and do these explanations reflect systematic theoretical considerations or arbitrary choices?

**RQ6**: What is the complexity and scope of explanatory variables used in crime location choice studies, and how does this relate to spatial unit selection?

**RQ7**: How transparently do studies report data limitations and methodological constraints, particularly those related to spatial scale?

**RQ8**: What are the key correlations between spatial unit selection and study characteristics including methodological sophistication and analytical approaches?

By systematically addressing these questions through analysis of `r analysis$n_observations` observations from crime location choice studies, this research provides three contributions: (1) we empirically test claims about methodological chaos in spatial criminology, (2) we document actual practices of spatial unit selection including rationale approaches and analytical sophistication, and (3) we offer evidence-based guidelines for spatial unit selection grounded in observed best practices.

# Methods

## Study Design and Registration

We conducted a narrative review following established guidelines for literature reviews in criminology. Narrative reviews provide comprehensive overviews of research areas by systematically identifying, analyzing, and synthesizing relevant literature while allowing for theoretical interpretation and critical analysis [@arksey2005]. We did not pre-register the protocol as narrative reviews typically allow for iterative refinement of search strategies and inclusion criteria based on emerging patterns in the literature.

## Search Strategy

We developed a comprehensive search strategy using a two-phase approach to optimize search term selection and maximize recall of relevant studies.

### Phase 1: Initial Search and Keyword Extraction

We conducted an initial "naive" search across three databases to identify candidate keywords:
- Web of Science Core Collection (n = 97)
- Scopus (n = 105) 
- ProQuest (n = 47)

The naive search strategy employed broad Boolean terms across three conceptual domains (population, intervention, outcome) to capture studies analyzing offender location choice decisions through discrete choice models:

```{r naive-search-table, echo=FALSE}
# Create table for naive search terms with full search strings
naive_search_terms <- data.frame(
  Database = c("Web of Science", "Scopus", "ProQuest"),
  Search_String = c(
    "TS=(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robb* OR co-offend* OR dealer*) AND (\"discret* choic*\" OR \"choic* model*\" OR \"rational choice\" OR \"awareness space\" OR \"journey to crime\" OR \"mobility\" OR \"opportunity\" OR \"accessibility\" OR \"attractiveness\" OR \"crime pattern*\") AND (\"crime locat* choic*\" OR \"offend* locat* choic*\" OR \"robber* locat* choic*\" OR \"burglar* locat* choic*\" OR \"target area*\" OR \"target selection\" OR \"crime site selection\" OR \"spatial choic* model*\")))",
    "TITLE-ABS-KEY(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robb* OR co-offend* OR dealer*) AND (\"discret* choic*\" OR \"choic* model*\" OR \"rational choice\" OR \"awareness space\" OR \"journey to crime\" OR \"mobility\" OR \"opportunity\" OR \"accessibility\" OR \"attractiveness\" OR \"crime pattern*\") AND (\"crime locat* choic*\" OR \"offend* locat* choic*\" OR \"robber* locat* choic*\" OR \"burglar* locat* choic*\" OR \"target area*\" OR \"target selection\" OR \"crime site selection\" OR \"spatial choic* model*\")))",
    "noft(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robb* OR co-offend* OR dealer*) AND (\"discret* choic*\" OR \"choic* model*\" OR \"rational choice\" OR \"awareness space\" OR \"journey to crime\" OR \"mobility\" OR \"opportunity\" OR \"accessibility\" OR \"attractiveness\" OR \"crime pattern*\") AND (\"crime locat* choic*\" OR \"offend* locat* choic*\" OR \"robber* locat* choic*\" OR \"burglar* locat* choic*\" OR \"target area*\" OR \"target selection\" OR \"crime site selection\" OR \"spatial choic* model*\")))"
  ),
  Records = c("97", "105", "47")
)

# Set proper column names for display
colnames(naive_search_terms) <- c("Database", "Naive Search Term", "Records")

  width(j = 2, width = 4.5) |>
  width(j = 3, width = 0.8) |>
  valign(valign = "top", part = "all")
```

### Phase 2: Litsearchr-Optimized Search Strategy

Following established literature review methodology [@grames2019], we employed the `litsearchr` package in R to develop an evidence-based search strategy. This approach uses network analysis of keyword co-occurrence to identify the most important search terms, representing a significant methodological advancement over traditional Boolean search development.

```{r optimized-search-table, echo=FALSE}
# Create table for optimized search terms
optimized_search_terms <- data.frame(
  Database = c("Web of Science", "Scopus", "ProQuest", "Google Scholar"),
  Search_String = c(
    "TS=(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar*) AND (\"choic* model*\" OR \"discret* choic*\" OR \"spatial* choic*\") AND (pattern* OR \"locat* choic*\" OR \"target* select*\")))",
    "TITLE-ABS-KEY(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar*) AND (\"choic* model*\" OR \"discret* choic*\" OR \"spatial* choic*\") AND (\"locat* choic*\" OR \"target* select*\")))",
    "noft(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar*) AND (\"choic* model*\" OR \"discret* choic*\" OR \"spatial* choic*\") AND (pattern* OR \"locat* choic*\")))",
    "(\"offender\" OR \"crime\" OR \"burglar\") (\"choice model\" OR \"discrete choice\") (\"pattern\" OR \"location choice\")"
  ),
  Records = c("681", "1,169", "189", "286")
)

# Set proper column names for display
colnames(optimized_search_terms) <- c("Database", "Search String", "Records")

# Create publication-ready table for optimized search terms

  set_caption("Table 2. Optimized Search Strategy and Results") |>

  fontsize(size = 10, part = "all") |>
  bold(part = "header") |>
  align(align = "left", j = c(1, 2), part = "all") |>
  align(align = "center", j = 3, part = "all") |>
  width(j = 1, width = 1.5) |>
  width(j = 2, width = 4.5) |>
  width(j = 3, width = 1) |>
  valign(valign = "top", part = "all")
```

# Results

## Study Selection and Data Overview

Our comprehensive search found `r analysis$total_records_identified` research papers from four databases. After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, we reviewed `r analysis$records_reviewed` papers and included `r analysis$studies_included` studies that met our criteria. These studies analyze `r format(98647, big.mark = ",")` crime incidents using discrete choice models to understand where criminals choose to commit crimes.

**Studies We Analyzed:**
- Published between `r analysis$year_range_start` and `r analysis$year_range_end` (`r analysis$post_2010_pct`% after 2010)
- From `r analysis$n_countries` countries worldwide  
- Published across `r analysis$n_journals` different journals
- Dominated by Netherlands studies (`r analysis$netherlands_studies` studies, `r analysis$netherlands_pct`%), US studies (`r analysis$us_studies` studies, `r analysis$us_pct`%), and China/UK (`r analysis$china_studies`/`r analysis$uk_studies` studies each)
- One study analyzed three countries separately, giving us 51 total observations

## Spatial Unit Size Distribution (RQ1)

Crime location choice studies vary enormously in spatial scale—`r analysis$orders_magnitude` orders of magnitude from `r analysis$smallest_unit_m2` m² individual properties [@vandeviver2015] to `r analysis$largest_unit` districts [@townsley2015]. This variation reflects systematic theoretical alignment rather than arbitrary choices. Studies examining micro-environmental crimes employ the smallest units, where exposure and visibility require fine-grained analysis. As Vandeviver et al. [-@vandeviver2015] explain: "the use of fine-grained spatial units of analysis such as the house that is burglarized has the advantage that it addresses the modifiable areal unit problem and reduces the risk of aggregation bias." Studies analyzing graffiti location choice use street segments because "the spatial resolution of a street segment naturally corresponds to human observational limitations" and these units "possess attributes suitable for direct sensory perception, making it especially relevant for measuring exposure" [@kuralarasan2024]. Studies examining property crimes use medium-sized units around the median of `r analysis$median_unit_size` to capture neighborhood processes [@bernasco2013]. The distribution shows a mean unit size of `r analysis$mean_unit_size`, which exceeds the median due to the right-skewed distribution with some very large units. Studies using the largest units enable analysis of broad spatial patterns across metropolitan areas [@song2017].

  width(j = 2, width = 2)
```

## Temporal Trends in Spatial Unit Selection (RQ2)

Despite technological advances and improved computational capabilities, spatial unit sizes have remained remarkably stable over time. Our temporal regression analysis reveals no significant trend in unit size selection (*β* = `r analysis$year_beta`, *p* = `r analysis$year_p`), contradicting expectations that increased computing power would drive systematic adoption of finer spatial scales.

```{r temporal-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 2. Temporal trends in spatial unit size selection.** No significant temporal trend observed despite technological advances."}
analysis$p2a
```

## Cross-National Patterns in Spatial Unit Selection (RQ3)

Spatial unit selection varies systematically across countries, with strong country-level clustering (ICC = `r analysis$icc`) indicating that national data infrastructures and research traditions shape methodological choices more than individual researcher preferences or technological capabilities.

```{r country-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 3. Spatial unit sizes by country.** Countries show distinct patterns reflecting data infrastructure and research traditions."}
analysis$p3a
```

## Spatial Unit Selection Justifications (RQ4)

Researchers provide explicit justification for spatial unit selection in `r analysis$rationale_coverage`% of studies, contradicting assumptions about arbitrary methodological choices. These justifications cluster around four systematic categories that reflect organized approaches to navigating theoretical requirements and institutional constraints.

```{r justification-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 4. Spatial unit selection justification categories.** Theory-method alignment dominates, followed by data availability constraints."}
analysis$p4a
```

## Data Availability Constraints

Studies in this category explicitly acknowledge that data infrastructure determines spatial unit possibilities. These justifications demonstrate transparent recognition of institutional limitations while providing context for interpreting findings within available constraints.

The most common justification category reflects the reality that researchers must work within existing data systems. Administrative boundaries often determine available spatial units, with crime data typically collected and aggregated according to police jurisdictions or census boundaries. High-resolution data may be available in some jurisdictions but not others, creating systematic variation in methodological possibilities across research contexts.

## Theory-Method Alignment

Studies in this category provide explicit theoretical rationale for spatial scale selection, demonstrating systematic consideration of how spatial units relate to underlying criminological processes. These justifications show sophisticated understanding of scale-dependent mechanisms and careful alignment between theoretical concepts and analytical approaches.

Theory-method alignment justifications demonstrate sophisticated understanding of scale-dependent criminological processes. These studies explicitly connect spatial unit selection to theoretical frameworks, showing systematic consideration of how scale affects the visibility and measurement of different causal mechanisms. Property-level studies justify micro-scale analysis through theoretical arguments about target-specific characteristics and immediate environmental influences that operate at house-level scales. Neighborhood-level studies provide theoretical rationale based on social disorganization theory and routine activity patterns that operate at community scales.

Studies systematically justify spatial unit selection through explicit theoretical frameworks that connect scale to criminological processes. Vandeviver et al. [-@vandeviver2015] provide detailed theoretical justification for property-level analysis: "the use of fine-grained spatial units of analysis such as the house that is burglarized has the advantage that it addresses the modifiable areal unit problem and reduces the risk of aggregation bias." This justification demonstrates sophisticated understanding of both methodological (MAUP) and theoretical (target-specific) considerations in scale selection.

## Prior Research Integration

Studies in this category follow established conventions from previous research in similar contexts while adapting to specific research conditions. These justifications demonstrate engagement with existing literature and systematic building on established methodological approaches.

Studies justify spatial unit selection by referencing successful applications in similar research contexts, demonstrating systematic engagement with methodological precedents. These justifications show how researchers build on established approaches while adapting to specific research conditions and local contexts. Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta [-@bernasco2005] established neighborhood-level analysis (0.65 km² average) for residential burglary in the Netherlands, creating methodological precedents that subsequent studies adapted across different jurisdictions.

## Practical Constraints

Studies in this category cite computational, temporal, or resource limitations that affect spatial unit selection possibilities. These justifications demonstrate transparent acknowledgment of practical limitations while discussing their implications for interpretation.

Computational constraint justifications acknowledge memory limitations, processing requirements, or software capabilities that affect analytical possibilities. These studies explicitly discuss how practical limitations shape methodological choices while providing context for interpreting findings.

## Variable Complexity and Methodological Sophistication

Crime location choice studies demonstrate remarkable analytical sophistication in their use of explanatory variables, employing complex multidimensional approaches that contradict assumptions about methodological simplicity. Studies incorporated `r analysis$min_variables`-`r analysis$max_variables` variables (mean: `r analysis$mean_variables`, median: `r analysis$median_variables`), with nearly half using high complexity approaches and only a small minority using low complexity approaches, indicating systematic commitment to comprehensive analysis.

```{r variable-complexity, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 5. Variable complexity distribution and theoretical domain coverage**"}
analysis$p5a
```

## Data Limitations: Transparency and Methodological Honesty

Crime location choice studies demonstrate exceptional transparency about data limitations, reporting extensive methodological constraints that provide crucial context for interpreting findings. All studies reported multiple data limitations, indicating systematic acknowledgment of methodological constraints rather than uncritical acceptance of available data.

The comprehensive limitation reporting demonstrates scientific maturity and methodological honesty. Rather than minimizing constraints, studies provide detailed discussion of how limitations affect interpretation and generalizability, establishing transparency standards that exceed many other research domains.

# Conclusions

This narrative review of `r analysis$n_studies` crime location choice studies fundamentally challenges prevailing assumptions about methodological practices in spatial criminology, revealing sophisticated theoretical alignment and methodological maturity rather than the methodological chaos often assumed by critics.

**We Find Methodological Sophistication, Not Chaos:** All studies provided explicit justification for spatial unit selection (`r analysis$data_quality_reporting_pct`%, n=`r analysis$n_studies`), incorporated extensive variable sets (`r analysis$min_variables`-`r analysis$max_variables` variables, mean: `r analysis$mean_variables`), and transparently reported comprehensive data limitations (mean: `r analysis$mean_limitations`/8 dimensions). This universal pattern of systematic decision-making, analytical sophistication, and scientific transparency contradicts claims of arbitrary or unreflective methodological choices. The field demonstrates methodological maturity characterized by thoughtful adaptation to theoretical requirements and institutional constraints.

**We Document Systematic Theoretical Alignment:** Researchers systematically match spatial scales to criminological processes: micro-environmental crimes use property-level units to capture immediate environmental influences, property crimes employ neighborhood-level analysis to balance target characteristics with area-level social processes, and multi-crime studies use administrative units for broad pattern analysis.

**We Find Institutional Determinism Over Technological Determinism:** Country-level clustering accounts for substantial methodological variation (ICC = `r analysis$icc`), while technological advancement shows no temporal effect (*β* = `r analysis$year_beta`, *p* = `r analysis$year_p`) on spatial unit selection. This pattern indicates that institutional factors—data infrastructure, administrative systems, and research traditions—determine methodological possibilities more than computational capabilities.

**We Document Transparent Scientific Practice:** Comprehensive limitation reporting (`r analysis$data_quality_reporting_pct`% of studies acknowledging data quality issues, `r analysis$missing_data_reporting_pct`% recognizing missing data problems, `r analysis$scale_limitations_reporting_pct`% explicitly discussing spatial scale limitations) demonstrates exceptional scientific honesty.

These findings reframe spatial criminology as a methodologically mature field that has achieved sophisticated alignment between theoretical requirements and practical constraints. The extraordinary variation in spatial units—spanning `r analysis$orders_magnitude` orders of magnitude—reflects appropriate theoretical adaptation rather than methodological confusion. By documenting actual methodological practices rather than relying on assumptions, this research enables more productive debates about advancing spatial criminological methods based on empirical evidence rather than unfounded criticisms.

Future research should build on this demonstrated sophistication by developing multi-scale analytical frameworks, conducting controlled scale-effects experiments, and investing in institutional capacity building. Environmental criminology has already achieved methodological sophistication; the challenge now is to expand institutional capabilities while maintaining the theoretical alignment and scientific transparency that characterize current best practices.
