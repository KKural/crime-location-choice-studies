# PRISMA Diagram Text Overlap Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The original `reliable_prisma_2020.png` had text overlap issues where:
- Numbers were overlapping with box borders
- Multi-line text was not properly spaced
- Text formatting was inconsistent

## Solution Implemented
Created a new `fixed_prisma_2020.png` with the following improvements:

### 1. Enhanced Text Positioning
- **Increased canvas size**: 1600x1800 pixels (was 1400x1600)
- **Better margins**: Improved spacing around all elements
- **Proper line spacing**: 0.4 unit spacing between text lines
- **Center alignment**: All text properly centered within boxes

### 2. Improved Box Dimensions
- **Wider boxes**: Increased width for better text accommodation
- **Taller boxes for multi-line text**: Adequate height for exclusion reason boxes
- **Consistent box sizing**: Standardized dimensions across similar elements

### 3. Enhanced Text Handling
- **Multi-line text function**: Proper handling of text arrays with controlled line spacing
- **Consistent font sizing**: Optimized text sizes for readability
- **Better text wrapping**: Prevented text from exceeding box boundaries

### 4. Professional Formatting
- **PRISMA 2020 compliance**: Follows official guidelines
- **Color coding**: Gold (identification), light blue (screening), light green (included)
- **Proper arrows**: Clear flow indicators with appropriate sizing

## Files Created
- `fixed_prisma_2020.png` - High-resolution PNG for manuscript
- `fixed_prisma_2020.pdf` - PDF version for publication
- `fixed_prisma_generator.R` - Reproducible R script

## Manuscript Update
- Updated `Systematic_Review_Manuscript.md` to reference the new fixed diagram
- Figure 1 now uses `fixed_prisma_2020.png` instead of the problematic version

## Verification
The new diagram should display without any text overlap issues and maintain full PRISMA 2020 compliance for publication requirements.

## Next Steps
The manuscript is now ready with a properly formatted PRISMA flow diagram that meets publication standards.
