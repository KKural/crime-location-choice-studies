# Data Extraction and Cleaning Pipeline - Completion Report

## Overview
The comprehensive R data extraction and cleaning pipeline has been successfully completed and tested. The pipeline consists of two main scripts that work together to produce analysis-ready data from systematic review data.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Extraction Script (`unified_comprehensive_extraction_split.R`)
- **Purpose**: Extracts and merges data from multiple CSV sources
- **Key Features**:
  - Robust temporal data extraction using improved regex patterns
  - Enhanced `extract_data_collection_period()` function with multiple search patterns
  - Comprehensive data merging from 4 main data sources
  - Handles various date formats and temporal indicators

### 2. Cleaning Script (`data_cleaning_comprehensive.R`)
- **Purpose**: Cleans and standardizes the extracted data
- **Key Features**:
  - Temporal data cleaning with standardized formats
  - Country name standardization
  - Numeric variable extraction (sample sizes, study areas, population data)
  - Crime type standardization
  - Status variable processing

## Key Achievements

### Temporal Data Extraction Success
From the examination of the final dataset (`20250709_analysis_ready_dataset_final_clean.csv`):

#### Data Collection Period
- Successfully extracted values such as:
  - "2006-2009"
  - "2012" 
  - "2008-2011"
  - "12-18 May 2016 (for mobile phone data)"
  - "October 2019 (for mobility flows)"
  - "November 2017"
  - "May to August 2019"
  - "August 2011 (implied)"

#### Study Period  
- Successfully extracted values such as:
  - "2005-2014"
  - "2004-2005"
  - "2006-2009"
  - "2012-2016"
  - "Approximately 4 years"
  - "1996-2004"
  - "2017-2018"

### Data Quality Improvements
1. **Enhanced Extraction Logic**: Improved regex patterns capture various temporal expressions
2. **Multiple Source Checking**: Extraction function checks multiple data fields for temporal information
3. **Standardized Output**: Consistent variable naming and data types
4. **Error Handling**: Robust processing that handles missing data gracefully

## Final Dataset Structure
- **Dimensions**: 51 studies × 52 variables
- **Key Variables Successfully Processed**:
  - `Data_Collection_Period`: Primary temporal variable with extracted data collection timeframes
  - `Study_Period`: Study duration information
  - `Country`: Standardized country names
  - `Crime_Type`: Standardized crime type categories
  - `Sample_Size_Numeric`: Numeric sample sizes
  - `Study_Area_Size_km2`: Numeric study area sizes
  - `Population_per_Unit_Numeric`: Numeric population data

## Validation Results
- ✅ Scripts run without errors
- ✅ Output files generated successfully
- ✅ Temporal data extraction working as intended
- ✅ Data cleaning and standardization functional
- ✅ Numeric variable extraction operational
- ✅ Final dataset is analysis-ready

## Output Files Generated
All files are saved in the `20250709_Analysis & Results/` directory:
- `20250709_unified_comprehensive_extraction_split.csv` - Raw extracted data
- `20250709_analysis_ready_dataset.csv` - Initial processed data
- `20250709_analysis_ready_dataset_cleaned.csv` - Intermediate cleaning
- `20250709_analysis_ready_dataset_final_clean.csv` - **Final analysis-ready dataset**

## Technical Notes
- The pipeline handles various temporal formats and expressions
- Missing temporal data is properly flagged as NA
- The extraction prioritizes explicit temporal statements over inferred dates
- All major systematic review data fields are processed and standardized

## Recommendations for Analysis
1. Use `Data_Collection_Period` as the primary temporal variable for analysis
2. Use `Study_Period` as supplementary temporal information
3. The dataset is now ready for statistical analysis and modeling
4. Consider temporal trends analysis using the extracted date ranges

## Conclusion
The data extraction and cleaning pipeline is fully operational and has successfully processed all 51 studies in the systematic review. The temporal data extraction has been significantly improved, and the final dataset is analysis-ready with minimal missing data in key variables.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Pipeline ready for production use
