Subject: Crime Location Choice SUoA Review - Manuscript Progress Update

Dear [Professor Names],

I wanted to provide you with a brief update on the spatial units of analysis (SUoA) manuscript we've been working on.

**Current Status:**
The manuscript draft is substantially complete and has undergone comprehensive revision for clarity, accuracy, and conciseness. The current version (20250717_Systematic_Review_Manuscript_Dynamic.Rmd) includes:

**Key Findings:**
- Analysis of SUoA selection practices across crime location choice studies
- SUoA sizes span multiple orders of magnitude, reflecting systematic scale-matching to research objectives
- Strong country-level clustering (ICC values) indicating national data infrastructures shape scale selection
- Crime-type specificity with systematic alignment between offence characteristics and spatial scales
- Rationale analysis identifying three major categories: Data Availability (45.1%), Theory-Method (35.3%), and Prior Research (27.5%)
- Evidence that variation stems from deliberate, context-sensitive decisions rather than arbitrary choices

**Completed Revisions:**
- Removed repetition and streamlined all major sections
- Corrected inconsistencies in terminology and data reporting
- Enhanced clarity in abstract, introduction, and conclusions
- Improved accuracy of statistical reporting and figure descriptions
- Eliminated unsupported claims and overstated conclusions
- Standardized language throughout for precision and neutrality

**Analysis Code:**
The analysis is fully reproducible through the R script (20250714_new_csv_analysis_clean.R), which generates all tables and figures automatically for the dynamic manuscript.

**Next Steps:**
I believe the manuscript is ready for your review and feedback. Would you prefer to:
1. Review the current draft and provide comments?
2. Discuss any specific aspects or sections in person/via call?
3. Proceed with submission preparations?

Please let me know your preferred timeline and any specific areas you'd like me to focus on for final refinements.

Best regards,
[Your name]
