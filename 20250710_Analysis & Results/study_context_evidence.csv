  - ""This study contributes two key innovations to the literature. First, we theorize the effects of prior crime locations.""
  - ""To test our hypotheses, multiple study variables were constructed based on these offenses. First, for each offense and the associated 142 alternative postal code areas, a dichotomous variable previously chosen (0 = no; 1 = yes) was constructed to indicate whether the offender had committed a prior offense in that particular postal code area in the previous 3 years (to test hypothesis 1).""

  - ""The results presented, in particular the finding that repeat offenders are attracted to locations in the proximity of where they recently committed a crime, is consistent with the finding that the same offenders are involved in the majority of (near-) repeat cases (Bernasco, 2008;Johnson, Summers, and Pease, 2009).""",,10
