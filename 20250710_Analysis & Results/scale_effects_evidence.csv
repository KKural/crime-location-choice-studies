"(Bernasco & Jacques, 2015)",Street_segment,Drug-related,0.001545,Netherlands,"- ""The two main features that distinguish our study from prior work on the geography of drug dealing are the detailed spatial scale of analysis and the emphasis on multiple methods.""

  - ""The detailed spatial scale allows us to measure and analyze relevant features of the environment in much greater detail than has been the case in most prior studies.""
  - ""The results of our analysis of the interview transcripts demonstrate that street segments are still too coarse as units of analysis, not only because they still cover too large territory but also because their relevant characteristics are not stable over time.""
  - ""The conclusion to be drawn from this observation could be, as we suggest, that future research should study offending at even smaller spatial units of analysis than street segments (e.g., 10 × 10 m grids, or even addresses).""
  - ""The rationale was that for decision making in dealing situations, what matters are the characteristics of a place that can be seen or heard, and it seemed that street segments (""street blocks,"" ""face blocks"") are small enough to assure that from any point in the street segment, relevant attributes of any other point in the same segment could be seen and heard.""

"(Bernasco et al., 2013)",Census_block,Robbery,0.01968,United States,"- ""In this article, we introduce three major advances over prior work on crime location choice. The first applies to spatial scale. While classic studies on the geography of crime (Shaw and McKay, 1942;Sampson et al., 1997) have used large urban areas as their spatial units of analysis, recent research suggests that often crime concentrations are not larger than a street segment (Smith et al., 2000;Weisburd et al., 2004) or street corner (McCord and Ratcliffe, 2007). To improve our understanding of the fine-grained spatial decisions of street robbers, we zoom in to the level of census blocks.""
  - ""We use data that are disaggregated to the level of census blocks. In Chicago, with an average surface of 140 m Â 140 m (460 ftÂ 460 ft) and an average population of 118 residents, census blocks are approximately 30 times smaller than census tracts.""
  - ""When performing the analysis on units as small as census blocks, spatial spillover effects are plausible (Bernasco, 2010). For example, a retail store that attracts robbers will not only pull robbers to the block where it is located, but also to adjacent blocks that are just across the street and around the corner.""
  - ""The hypothesis is not self-evident, however, because the opposite phenomenon, spatial competition, is plausible as well. Spatial competition implies that the presence of robbery attractors in adjacent blocks pulls away robbers from the focal block and thus has a negative effect in the probability of robbery in the focal block.""
  - ""The existence of this 'spatial agglomeration effect' (Fotheringham, 1988) was expected because street robbers must attack close to the businesses that their potential victims are heading to or returning from, as otherwise the victims will have entered their homes, vehicles, public transport or other facilities.""
  - ""the universal logit model was extended with the 15 same attributes of second-order spatially adjacent blocks (because of computer memory limitations we used a sample of 4000 instead of 6000 alternatives for this analysis). With one single exception, the estimates (presented in Supplementary Table S4 of the Supplementary Appendix) were nonsignificant.""
  - ""the estimates of the spatially lagged adjacent block variables indicate that robbery attraction spills over to adjacent blocks. The effects of the 'spatially lagged' variables, listed in the bottom part of Table 4 under the 'Adjacent blocks' heading, are positive like those of the regular variables, indicating that the same factors that make robbers select a particular block also make them select adjacent blocks.""",,10
"(Bernasco et al., 2017)",Census_block,Robbery,0.01968,United States,"- ""The spatial units of analysis are census blocks.""
  - ""The blocks had a median size of 19,680 m 2 (approximately 140 Â 140 m), and there were 5,867 blocks without a residential function.""
  - ""The analysis is limited to cleared robberies because only for cleared robberies offender addresses are available, and distance from the offender home location is by far the most important predictive factor in crime location choice""
  - ""Euclidian distances were calculated between the homes of the offenders and the midpoints of each of the 24,594 census blocks.""
  - ""The home-crime distance follows a typical distance decay distribution with a long tail, indicating that the majority of home-crime trips were short and very few were long.""

In the next section, theoretical perspectives and research are reviewed to introduce the theoretical model. The second and third sections describe the data and analytic strategy, respectively. The latter includes a discussion of the application of graph theory to quantify the character of the road network, as well as the statistical model employed.""
  - ""The study area was defined by identifying the ""built-up areas"" of the three towns and by applying a 1-km buffer around them (for a map of the study area, see appendix A in the online supporting information 1 ). The resulting study area covers a geography of approximately 150 km 2 and includes 81,682 dwellings situated on 5,286 street segments.""
  - ""the choice-set includes only roads and paths from which residential properties can plausibly be accessed (i.e., it excludes alleyways, motorways, paths, and slip roads) and where at least one property exists.""
  - ""For example, people do not navigate from one large area to another; they navigate along the road network. As such, a spatial resolution at this scale (e.g., street segment) should better capture the spatial logic of offender decision-making (Johnson and Bowers, 2010). Also, as constructs such as (the potential for) guardianship and awareness spaces can be more precisely measured at this level, street segments are a natural unit for studying crime (Weisburd, Groff, and Yang, 2012).""
  - ""The use of this framework has now become well established in the criminological literature, although the units of analysis considered are typically large areal units (for an overview of studies, see appendix C in the online supporting information).""
  - ""For parsimony, table 3 shows the results for the key variables of interest, along with the model fits from the ML models.""
  - ""In terms of the overall fit of the final model, interpretation of the RLH is not as simple as for the R squared values associated with (say) ordinary least-squares models, or even the pseudo R-squared values computed for conditional logit models (see McFadden, 1974).""
  - ""In summary, in the current study, we used graph theory metrics and a mixed logit approach to test theories of criminal location choice for the crime of burglary. Analyses were conducted at a much finer spatial scale than has been generally the case hitherto.""
  - ""This choice of scale enabled the generation of novel ""idiosyncratic"" measures of offender awareness. These might be further developed in future research with other anchor points of importance to an offender, such as place of work or other locations.""",,14

  - ""if features are proximity measures, such as distances to key locations, then the inter-centroid spacing should be smaller than the minimum distance between these locations.""

  - ""In general, finer spatial granularity are to be preferred (see also Weisburd et al., 2009).

That is, because while acquisitive offenders are assumed to be rational and often financial motivated and so they should prefer more affluent targets where greater proceeds are expected, those targets may also be better protected, and so offenders could also prefer less affluent areas where the targets are expected to be less well protected. As such, and again considering the estimated significant variation over the sample, the disagreement in results may result from slight differences in the samples or study areas and this should be explored.""

"(Bernasco et al., 2015)",Lower_Level_Super_Output_Area_(LSOA),Burglary,0.51,United Kingdom,"- ""The study reported here aims to further explore questions of repeat crime location choices and differs in three key aspects from the study by Lammers et al.

(2015) used areas with an average population of 7,000 residents, the areas used here have an average population of only 1,500, potentially providing for more homogeneous spatial units and enhanced ecological validity.""
  - ""The concept of crime location choice presumes spatial units of analysis, which are the alternative locations that burglars choose from when deciding on where to commit a burglary. Whereas the contemporary literature on the geography of crime emphasizes the analytical superiority of small spatial units (e.g., micro-places like face blocks or street segments), the implementation of units of such small size in spatial choice models is fraught with complex issues, including the need to use 'sampling from alternatives' to solve the intractability of the estimation problem, and the requirement to estimate multiple-level spillover effects""
  - ""As a compromise, we decided to use the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) geography as the basic spatial unit of analysis. LSOAs are defined on the basis of proximity and social homogeneity measures (type of dwelling and nature of tenure) and have a population of approximately 1,500 residents and 600 households.""
  - ""Spillover effects can be assessed using either hierarchical spatial nesting structures or spatial proximity structures (Bernasco & Elffers, 2010). Because the boundaries of the UK census areas are designed to optimize social homogeneity in terms of household tenure and dwelling type (Haining, 2012;Sturgis, Brunton-Smith, Kuha, & Jackson, 2013), we preferred the former, and estimated spillover using variables measured at the next higher level of the census geography in the UK, the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA).""
  - ""The estimated effects of prior burglaries in the same MSOA also display a pattern of temporal decay, from an odds ratio of 3.6 for burglaries 0-2 days ago down to an odds ratio of 1.4 for burglaries 6-24 months ago.""
  - ""For each category (e.g., '0-2 days' or '3-6 days') in Table 1 , the LSOA estimate is larger than the MSOA estimate, suggesting that having committed a prior burglary in the same LSOA makes a burglar more likely to target the LSOA than just having committed a prior burglary in the same MSOA.""
  - ""the local effect is stronger than the spillover effect. This is to be expected, because the primary effect of previous burglaries is presumably that the burglar becomes aware of the direct environment of the targeted property (the LSOA). The awareness of the wider environment (the MSOA) is probably more diffuse and more likely to be a secondary effect.""",,12

"(Bernasco & Nieuwbeerta, 2005)",Neighborhood,Burglary,0.65,Netherlands,"- ""The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives.""

"(Bernasco & Block, 2009)",Census_tract,Robbery,0.7,United States,"- ""Although smaller units of analysis minimize within-unit heterogeneity, the census tract was chosen as the spatial unit of analysis because it was the lowest level of aggregation for which the ""collective efficacy"" measure was available and because computationally the use of the resource-intensive discrete choice model with smaller spatial units of analysis would have required a drastic reduction in sample size.""
  - ""In the spatial choice model, the spatial unit of analysis applies to the definition of what it is that offenders choose when they decide where to offend.

  - ""In future work, it might be advisable to use smaller units of spatial aggregation. Using census tracts, 28 percent of the offenders committed a robbery in their home census tract.

  - ""Furthermore, our reading of the empirical literature that addresses the modifiable area unit problem in the context of crime (e.g., Hipp, 2007; Wooldredge, 2002) is that effects tend to be fairly robust across geographic levels of aggregation.""",,7

First, given the well-corroborated finding that burglary risk of a residence is heightened in the wake of a previous burglary (Ellingworth et al. 1995;Farrell and Pease 2001;Polvi et al. 1991), repeated victimization could be reflected in repeated targeting of the same residence by the same offenders.""
  - ""In conclusion, theoretical accounts of offender spatial decision-making have highlighted that target selection may be affected not only by attributes of potential targets but also by attributes of their spatial context.
