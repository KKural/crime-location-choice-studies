  - ""The rationale was that for decision making in dealing situations, what matters are the characteristics of a place that can be seen or heard, and it seemed that street segments (""street blocks,"" ""face blocks"") are small enough to assure that from any point in the street segment, relevant attributes of any other point in the same segment could be seen and heard.""

While classic studies on the geography of crime (Shaw and McKay, 1942;Sampson et al., 1997) have used large urban areas as their spatial units of analysis, recent research suggests that often crime concentrations are not larger than a street segment (Smith et al., 2000;Weisburd et al., 2004) or street corner (McCord and Ratcliffe, 2007).

"(Clare et al., 2009)",Burglary,Residential_suburb,6.7,Administrative,"- ""The city of Perth is located in the south-west of Western Australia at the coast of the Indian Ocean. The estimated residential population of Perth in 2001 was 1,381,298 people.

  - ""A total of 291 residential suburbs were selected as members of the possible choice set for the residential burglaries examined here.""
  - ""It is important to note here that the term suburb as used in Western Australia has a different meaning to other parts of the world (particularly the United States and Canada), and is more akin to a neighbourhood in these areas.""
  - ""The overall geographic placement of these suburbs in relation to the Swan River, selected major roads, and the location of the railway line are displayed in Figure 1""
  - ""The essential elements involved with the application of discrete spatial choice are: (a) defining the boundaries of the choice set, (b) capturing the unique attributes of the decision-makers and (c) modelling the interaction between the individual chooser's characteristics and choice for the whole population (McFadden, 1974).""
  - ""The final dataset contained 1,761 singleoffender (actual or attempted) residential burglaries committed between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002 , where the offender resided in the city of Perth.""
  - ""The advantage of the discrete spatial choice approach is that it places realistic constraints on those 'bounded rational choices' that rational choice theorists discuss (Cornish & Clarke, 1986).""
