- The size of these block groups is not explicitly mentioned in terms of square kilometers or meters, but it is implied that they are the smallest units available for meaningful sociodemographic data.
- The total number of block groups used in the study is initially 334, but after removing some due to missing data, the final number is 304.

  - ""Although smaller units of analysis minimize within-unit heterogeneity, the census tract was chosen as the spatial unit of analysis because it was the lowest level of aggregation for which the ""collective efficacy"" measure was available and because computationally the use of the resource-intensive discrete choice model with smaller spatial units of analysis would have required a drastic reduction in sample size.""
  - ""Furthermore, our reading of the empirical literature that addresses the modifiable area unit problem in the context of crime (e.g., Hipp, 2007; Wooldredge, 2002) is that effects tend to be fairly robust across geographic levels of aggregation.""
