  - ""The data collection technique is not without its drawbacks. The inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a bias sample, as these cannot be coded.""
  - ""Given that some interviewed offenders even stated that they preferred isolated properties, this is a particularly problematic shortcoming.""
  - ""A resolvable issue for future research would be an exploration into whether behaviour varies depending on the time of day (e.g. Montoya, Junger, & Ongena, 2016).""
  - ""It is worthwhile noting that this study cannot claim to have infallibly replicated the experience of a burglar selecting a suitable target.""
  - ""The measurements and statistical analyses employed cannot necessarily capture all of the nuances glimpsed from one-on-one interviews in previous research.""
  - ""The downside of this research design is that one cannot estimate predicted probabilities of burglary, given that the sample is not representative.""
  - ""The method of creating the four main constructs assumes that each item is equally important. To assess this assumption, sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to explore the extent to which the items were constructed and weighted suitably.""
  - ""The results suggested that some items are 'unhappy' being weighted equally to other items within the constructs.""
  - ""Robustness checks were carried out using alternative neighbourhood boundaries to explore whether the reported results were a statistical artefact caused by a poorly defined neighbourhood unit.""",,11

Although there is potential for legal repercussions, indicating a need for risk consideration, our focus is on how the desire for exposure and recognition influences the choices of graffiti locations due to the limitations of our data.""
  - ""While our study offers insights into the spatial preferences of graffiti writers, it has some limitations. First, our observations and conclusions are derived from a specific urban context. Since the nature of graffiti and public perceptions toward it can vary in different urban environments, the behaviors of graffiti writers may differ as well.""
  - ""Second, we have not observed graffiti along railway tracks or on trains and in locations that were accessible and known only to graffiti writers. This exclusion limits our understanding of graffiti in these specific areas, which might exhibit different patterns and motivations.""
  - ""Third, while our study primarily examines the roles of exposure in guiding graffiti placement, we acknowledge that these factors may not encompass the full spectrum of motivations for graffiti writers.""

  - ""The statistical approach taken here reflects the small size of our sample, which is too small to allow statistical inference.""
  - ""the selection of the study area and the method of recruitment imply that we mainly gained access to mobile dealers who sell in the streets to strangers, in particular but not exclusively to tourists.""
  - ""The overall study sample consisted of 50 subjects who were active as dealers in downtown Amsterdam.""
  - ""The observation of a single street segment took 15 minutes on average.""
  - ""The inter-observer reliability was evaluated by calculating measures of association between the two observations of a single segment, that is, Pearson's product-moment correlation for continuous variables and Spearman's ρ for rank-ordered variables.""
  - ""The time window for observations only partially overlapped with the time window for interview recruitment period (5 p.m.-10 p.m.), which may have created temporal disparities between when alternative characteristics and revealed preferences were observed.""
  - ""The results of our analysis of the interview transcripts demonstrate that street segments are still too coarse as units of analysis, not only because they still cover too large territory but also because their relevant characteristics are not stable over time.""
  - ""Structural data collection that aims to rigorously test propositions about spatial criminal choices must utilize sufficiently large samples.""

"(Bernasco et al., 2013)",Census_block,Robbery,0.01968,United States,"- ""Unfortunately, the data did not allow us to identify offenders across multiple robberies. More generally, it did not contain information on prior crimes or past residential addresses of the offenders.""
  - ""Our discrete choice model assumes that robbers in Chicago know the attributes of all 24,594 census blocks. This is a strong assumption, as robbers will typically have detailed knowledge only of the area in the vicinity of their home and around specific activity nodes that are part of their daily routines, legal ones like school, work and leisure and possibly illegal ones like dealing of buying drugs.""
  - ""Our findings confirm that proximity to home is among the most important criteria for deciding on a robbery location. This finding could also reflect that robbers are not aware of potential robbery locations located farther away, locations that effectively are not part of their choice set.""
  - ""Our data did not contain appropriate localized measures of factors that could potentially deter robbers and force them to choose alternative robbery locations.""
  - ""Although it is important that future work includes such measures, their inclusion in empirical models may not be straightforward. Many of the factors that might deter robbers could actually be reactions of law enforcement, potential victims and other offenders to elevated robbery rates.""
  - ""Our inquiry neglects such temporal variations and temporal constraints, and future research could improve our understanding of target selection by where K is the number of attributes, X kni is the value of attribute X k of alternative i for decision-maker n and k is a parameter associated with X k that can be estimated when the actual choices have been observed.""

  - ""Unfortunately, the business data did not include information on opening and closing hours and days.""
  - ""An important caveat of the present analysis is that time (hours, days) is used as a proxy measure for the physical presence of other people and for the tangible circumstance that a certain shop or business is actually open.""
  - ""We did not actually measure each business' opening hours, measure the average number of people present per census block per time slot, or count numbers of vulnerable people on the streets.""
  - ""Future research in this area should be able to take advantage of the increasing availability of unobtrusive and automatically collected georeferenced measures of human presence through contemporary developments in information and communication technologies, including smartphones and other location services, and social media""

  - ""Unfortunately, other attributes, such as the real estate value of residences in Japan, are not readily available.""
  - ""And given that it is relatively common that elements of the city centre (e.g., main stations, government buildings, public facilities, and commercial facilities) are distributed widely inside cities in Japan, it is difficult to define a single point as the city centre in Japan.""
  - ""the proportion of cases affecting single-family dwellings targeted in test data should be sufficiently small to make clear the relevance of the connection between the proportion of single-family dwellings and physical accessibility.""
  - ""A part of the calculated values is more than 100%, this was because the national census includes errors caused by blank returns or mistakes by respondents.""
  - ""the past residential burglary rate was sometimes overestimated when grid cells had a small number of residential units as a denominator and had recorded vanishingly few reported cases for 3 years.""
  - ""The results of this study showed that the past crime data have a significant impact on the choice of location for crimes made by later offenders. However, neither the number of past residential burglaries nor the past residential burglary rate is explanatory indices.""
  - ""Although there are certain limitations in this study, the study is significant because it indicated that past crime data are effective for indexing the attractiveness of neighbourhoods for residential burglars.""

  - ""replication is needed to establish the external validity of the findings reported here, and future research might seek to do so comprising other forms of data.""

  - ""The choice set was defined using the following steps. The smallest rectangle that would wholly circumscribe the boundaries of the City of Richmond was the extents of a grid with 100 rows and 100 columns.""
  - ""The candidate predictor set, F, consists of proximity measurements to each of 30 features in the geographic space and 38 demographic profile variables aggregated at the census block group level.""

"(Bernasco, 2019)",Grid_cell,Multiple Types,0.04,Netherlands,"- ""Police data are not collected for the purpose of scientific research, and they are incomplete for two reasons. First, police data on crime exclude those crimes that victims did not report to the police. Based on the International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS), it is estimated that in western countries on average about 50 percent of crime victims report to the police, a figure that is 58 percent in The Netherlands""
  - ""Second, police data on offenders are incomplete because they exclude offenders who are not apprehended. Internationally, the percentage of reported crime for which an offender is identified (the clearance rate) is 34 percent, but it is only 13 percent in the Netherlands""
  - ""Since both selection mechanisms-reporting and clearance-are unlikely to be random, generalizations based on police data must be made with great caution.""
  - ""Compared to data automatically extracted from mobile phone networks (e.g., [8,10,20,22]), space-time budget data has two disadvantages. First, because of the high fieldwork costs, samples sizes are generally limited to less than 1,000 whereas mobile phone network data typically include over 40,000 phone users.""
  - ""Second, because of participants' memory limitations, reliable space-time budget data cannot cover more than a few days whereas mobile phone data often cover multiple months or even years.""
  - ""the measurement of the participants' whereabouts took place October-May, a period during which the maximum daily temperature averages ~10˚Celsius.

  - ""The findings presented here will not directly help prevent crime, because they do not inform us about who the prospective offenders are and when they will commit crimes.""
  - ""the confidence intervals around the point estimates are rather large. This is partly due to the sparseness of the data (165 crimes relative to the total number of 4558 grid cells), but it also indicates that there is a fair amount of heterogeneity that is not covered by the explanatory variables.""",,15

"(Marchment & Gill, 2019)",Small_areas,Terrorist Attacks By The Provisional Irish Republican Army (Pira),0.15,Northern Ireland,"- ""As with many quantitative studies of terrorism and political violence there are a number of constraints associated with the data used in this study. Some difficulties were encountered due to the historical nature of the records used.""
  - ""It was not possible to test the function of such factors and others (e.g. affluence levels), as appropriate figures were unavailable.""
  - ""This dataset is a slightly smaller sample in comparison to most previous similar studies of crime. There may be some parameter inflation and there is the possibility of skewing of distributions to values higher than the true odds ratio.""

  - ""There are several ways this study could be improved and expanded on through the further disaggregation of data. Initially, we aimed to distinguish between different types of targets (i.e.

attacks on premises and attacks on individuals), as different types of crimes tend to exhibit different spatial patterns (Andresen and Linning, 2012). However, there was insufficient data to do so.""",,8

  - ""The dependency in the data associated with reoffending has the potential to lead to errors of statistical inference.""
  - ""The use of the latter will undoubtedly be necessary if hypotheses such as those articulated above are to be tested in the future.""
  - ""Second, it is perhaps surprising that the control variables used here-the number of vehicles in an area and the number of car parks-appeared to have little or no influence on offender spatial decision making.""

"(S. van Sleeuwen et al., 2021)",Neighborhood,Multiple Types,2.63,Netherlands,"- ""Although this first empirical test provides some evidence for our extended theory, it is important to emphasise that our conclusions are tentative as the size of our sample of offences was quite small (N = 71 offences committed by 30 offenders).""
  - ""Also, a non-experimental research design obviously cannot fully rule out possible selection bias.""
  - ""As our respondents were sampled from police register data on suspected offenders from two specific police regions in the western part of the Netherlands (The Hague and Noord-Holland), we might not be able to generalize our findings to the broader offender population; to offenders in other parts of the country or to offenders that escaped arrest.""

  - ""Note that any bias introduced by missing information on past home addresses will lead to conservative estimates of the effect of residential history on crime-location choice; missing addresses will make the role of residential history look smaller than it actually is.""
  - ""The first reason for exclusion was because individuals in the police records could not be linked to the citizen information system because the arrested persons were not Dutch citizens but, for example, were tourists or irregular migrants.""

"(Bernasco, 2010b)",Postal_code_area,Burglary,2.96,Netherlands,"- ""the burglary clearance rate in the Greater The Hague area was about 8% in the period covered. Thus, the burglaries included in the analysis amount to a small minority of all residential burglaries reported to the police.""

  - ""The evidence we provide is tentative in part because some of the hypothesized differences lacked statistical significance, although their estimated values were consistently in support of the theory.""
  - ""Offender accounts may also help to assess the reliability of the residential histories in official government systems. It is likely that the residential addresses in the GBA system do not always reflect where people actually live.""
  - ""For example, if someone failed to report their last move, their registered current residence is actually their former address.""
  - ""Because data unreliability tends to mask real effects, our estimates of the effects of residential history are probably conservative.""
  - ""The availability of historical offender addresses has been a major strength in the present study, but future studies will probably need to contact offenders themselves and rely on their recollection of events.""

  - ""Third, the dataset did not permit the researchers to uniquely identify offenders and to precisely determine the influence of prolific offenders on target choice.""
  - ""Fourth, it must be acknowledged that the discrete spatial choice model presents researchers with the outcomes of 'practical consciousness' (Giddens, 1984, p. 375) , and that despite the success of this 'choice' approach, the extent to which offender behaviour is accounted for by rational choices rather than unconscious routine remains uncertain.""
  - ""A further issue concerns the selection of the spatial scale for burglary analysis in this case. This is a complex problem and there may be no solution that is applicable across the ecology of different cities.""

"(Townsley et al., 2016)",Statistical_local_areas,Burglary,8.48,Australia,"- ""As with all studies of offender mobility that use recorded crime data, revealed preferences reflect those of cleared residential burglaries only.""

  - ""Finally, while the mixed logit variation of the discrete spatial choice approach relaxes a number of assumptions inherent in all discrete spatial choice studies, we remain encumbered by several others which likely warrant further empirical investigation.""
  - ""These include:

(1) that the choice process used to locate suitable targets is hierarchical in structure; (2) that the geographies selected to represent choices are both an adequate reflection of offender choice perceptions and are not compromised by excessive internal heterogeneity; and (3) no significant changes over time in either the behavioral rule applied by offenders in selecting targets, or the choices selected in targeting particular locations take place.""
  - ""With respect to the first and second, it may be that modelling preference variability is more feasible at smaller units of analysis than the neighborhoods used here.""
