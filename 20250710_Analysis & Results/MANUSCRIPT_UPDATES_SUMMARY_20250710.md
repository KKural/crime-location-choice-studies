- Added standard deviation (1.91 km²) and skewness (2.05)
- Maintained key finding of 4+ orders of magnitude variation

#### Temporal Trends (3.3):

- Updated ICC: 33.1% (was 31%)
- Updated R²: 0.004 (was 0.018)

#### Jurisdictional Differences (3.4):

  1. Belgium: 0.0008 km²
  2. Japan: 0.025 km²
  3. Northern Ireland: 0.15 km²
  4. United States: 0.216 km²
  5. United Kingdom: 0.385 km²
  6. New Zealand: 1.41 km²
  7. China: 1.62 km²
  8. India: 2.18 km²
  9. Netherlands: 2.63 km²
  10. Australia: 8.48 km²

- Updated Anglo-Saxon comparison with medians
- Added effect size: Cohen's d = 0.132
- Updated statistical tests: t-test p = 0.736, Wilcoxon p = 0.170

#### Methodological Factors (3.7):
- **Major Update**: Emphasized country clustering (ICC = 33.1%) as key finding
- Updated model R²: 31.1% (was 60.7%)
- Removed graffiti-specific finding (not significant in new analysis)
- Added ICC as structural effect in results table

### 2. Updated Discussion Section (Section 4)

**Main Findings (4.1):**
- Updated explanation: Study area explains 31.1% in multivariate model
- Updated temporal trend description with new coefficient
- Updated ICC reference: 33.1%

**Technological Determinism (4.3.4):**
- Updated coefficient: β = 0.012, p > 0.05
- Updated time span: "20+ years" (more accurate)

**Infrastructure Investment (4.4.3):**
- Updated ICC reference: 33.1%

### 3. Updated Conclusions Section (Section 5)

**Key Contributions:**
- Updated ICC values throughout: 33.1%
- Updated temporal trend findings
- Maintained focus on institutional effects over technological determinism

### 4. Figure References Updated

All figure references updated to point to `20250710_Analysis & Results/` directory:
- enhanced_distribution_analysis.png
- enhanced_temporal_analysis.png
- enhanced_temporal_mixed_effects.png
- enhanced_jurisdictional_analysis.png

### 5. Key Interpretative Changes

**Hypothesis Testing Results:**
1. **Temporal Miniaturization Hypothesis: REJECTED** (strengthened conclusion)
   - No significant trend toward smaller units over time
   - Technology advancement doesn't drive methodological change

2. **Anglo-Saxon Infrastructure Hypothesis: REJECTED**
   - No significant difference after controlling for other factors
   - Effect size very small (Cohen's d = 0.132)

3. **Country Clustering Hypothesis: STRONGLY CONFIRMED**
   - 33.1% ICC shows substantial between-country variation
   - Institutional factors dominate individual study characteristics

**New Emphasis on:**
- Jurisdictional clustering as primary structural finding
- Institutional context over technological determinism
- Lack of temporal convergence despite technology advances
- Evidence-based country rankings by typical unit size

### 6. Maintained Consistency

**Kept unchanged:**
- Core argument about sophisticated theoretical choices
- Study area size as strongest predictor
- Crime type matching patterns
- Quality assessment findings
- Methodological framework and recommendations

### 7. Statistical Precision Improvements

**Enhanced reporting:**
- More precise p-values and confidence intervals
- Clearer effect size reporting
- Better differentiation between different statistical tests
- More accurate temporal range (2003-2025)
- Updated sample sizes and counts where relevant

## Summary

The manuscript now accurately reflects the analysis of the merged dataset with 51 studies from 2003-2025. The key finding remains that spatial unit selection is sophisticated and theory-driven, but the emphasis has shifted to highlight institutional clustering over temporal trends, with strong evidence against technological determinism in methodological choice.
