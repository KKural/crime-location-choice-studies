  - ""The rationale was that for decision making in dealing situations, what matters are the characteristics of a place that can be seen or heard, and it seemed that street segments (""street blocks,"" ""face blocks"") are small enough to assure that from any point in the street segment, relevant attributes of any other point in the same segment could be seen and heard.""

While classic studies on the geography of crime (Shaw and McKay, 1942;Sampson et al., 1997) have used large urban areas as their spatial units of analysis, recent research suggests that often crime concentrations are not larger than a street segment (Smith et al., 2000;Weisburd et al., 2004) or street corner (McCord and Ratcliffe, 2007).

  - ""Since the four-digit postal code areas were designed to have minimal travel restrictions for postal delivery services travelling by bike or foot (Bernasco 2010b) , it is plausible that those living in or frequently visiting such an area will be familiar with it.""",,3
"(Menting et al., 2016)",Postal_code_area,Not Specified,2.96,Netherlands,"- ""Dutch four-digit postal code areas are designed to have minimal travel restrictions for postal delivery services that usually travel by foot or bicycle, and their size is inversely related to the level of urbanization (Bernasco, 2010: 398)""

  - ""In previous studies, it was argued that four-digit postal code areas are well-suited for crime location choice research, as these administrative areas were constructed in such a way to have minimal travel restrictions for postal delivery services that usually travel on foot or bicycle (Bernasco 2010:398)""

  - ""In terms of their size, shape, and topography, the postal code area is a useful approximation of the area one would expect people to be familiar with if they lived within it.""
  - ""postal code boundaries have been designed with post delivery services in mind. This design ensures that minimal physical restrictions on travel are in place within the postal code area and that the areas invite local travel by foot and bicycle (which is how post generally is delivered in the Netherlands).""
  - ""the size of postal code areas is related inversely to the level of urbanization. Postal codes in urban areas usually cover less than half a square mile, whereas postal codes in more rural regions are larger (less than 2 square miles).""

  - ""The postal code system was created with the facilitation of postal delivery services in mind. Therefore, a single postal code is nearly always on the same street, applies to adjacent properties, and is not subdivided by physical barriers that impede pedestrian or car transportation.""
  - ""the study area (Greater The Hague Area) measures 400 sq. km, and houses a population of 1,000,000 residents in 460,000 residential units. This area comprises 26,214 postal code areas.""

  - ""the qualifications of a behavior setting (Barker 1968;Wicker 1987) or setting (Wikstro ¨m 2006) seem to fit the postal code area unit well.""
  - ""the main criterion for choosing a particular unit of analysis is the theory to be tested. The unit of analysis should match the theory""
  - ""Many contemporary scholars in geographic criminology advocate the use of much smaller spatial units of analysis (Groff et al. 2009;Oberwittler and Wikstro ¨m 2009;Smith et al. 2000)""
  - ""The first reason to favor small spatial units is the generic principle in all sciences that to understand the characteristics and behavior of an object of inquiry, it is helpful to understand the characteristics and the behavior of its constituting elements, as well as the nature of the relations between these constituting elements.""",,10

"(Clare et al., 2009)",Residential_suburb,Burglary,6.7,Australia,"- ""The city of Perth is located in the south-west of Western Australia at the coast of the Indian Ocean. The estimated residential population of Perth in 2001 was 1,381,298 people. Perth is the largest city in Western Australia, with suburbs that sprawl along the coast for approximately 100 km and extend inland from the coast by up to 40 km.""
  - ""A total of 291 residential suburbs were selected as members of the possible choice set for the residential burglaries examined here.""
  - ""It is important to note here that the term suburb as used in Western Australia has a different meaning to other parts of the world (particularly the United States and Canada), and is more akin to a neighbourhood in these areas.""
  - ""The overall geographic placement of these suburbs in relation to the Swan River, selected major roads, and the location of the railway line are displayed in Figure 1""
  - ""The essential elements involved with the application of discrete spatial choice are: (a) defining the boundaries of the choice set, (b) capturing the unique attributes of the decision-makers and (c) modelling the interaction between the individual chooser's characteristics and choice for the whole population (McFadden, 1974).""
  - ""The final dataset contained 1,761 singleoffender (actual or attempted) residential burglaries committed between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002 , where the offender resided in the city of Perth.""
  - ""The advantage of the discrete spatial choice approach is that it places realistic constraints on those 'bounded rational choices' that rational choice theorists discuss (Cornish & Clarke, 1986).""
  - ""A further issue concerns the selection of the spatial scale for burglary analysis in this case. This is a complex problem and there may be no solution that is applicable across the ecology of different cities.""",,10

  - ""The map of average b i coefficients per SLA is displayed in Fig. 3""
  - ""The overall variation in b i coefficients appears only partially related to the spatial nesting of burglars in SLAs.""
