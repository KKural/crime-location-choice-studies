- The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, indicating that it focuses on how burglars select houses to burglarize.
- The study uses data from East Flanders, Belgium, and involves a discrete spatial choice model to analyze burglary target selection.
- The paper discusses the rational choice perspective and its application to understanding burglary target selection.
- The study area is described as the province of East Flanders, with data collected between 2006 and 2012.
- The paper includes analysis of 650 unique burglars and their burglaries.
- The Belgian Land Registry data is used to gather information on house attributes.
- The paper presents findings from bootstrapped conditional logit models and discusses limitations and future research directions.","- The study period is clearly mentioned as ""between 2006 and 2012"" for the recorded crime data on burglaries.
- The data collection period is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the data was collected up to 2012 since that is the end year of the study period.
- The data sources include ""the Belgian Federal Police"" for crime data and ""the Belgian Land Registry"" for residential property data.
- There is no explicit mention of data limitations or availability issues in the provided text.","- The paper uses the ""house"" as the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA Type), which is a fine-grained spatial unit.
- The study area is described as the entire province of East Flanders, covering nearly 3,000 km² with a population of approximately 1.5 million inhabitants.
- The number of units is specified as 503,589 residential properties.
- The rationale for choosing the house as the SUoA is to address the modifiable areal unit problem and reduce aggregation bias, as well as to conduct research at the most fine-grained spatial resolution available.
- The justification category is Theory–method, as the choice is based on theoretical considerations about the nature of burglary and the need for fine-grained analysis.
- The justification summary is that using houses as the spatial unit allows for a more accurate analysis of burglary target selection by addressing methodological issues and aligning with the nature of the crime.","- The country where the study was conducted is clearly mentioned as Belgium.
- The specific city or region studied is the province of East Flanders.
- The study area size is given as nearly 3,000 km².
- The study area description is provided as a densely urbanized polycentric area with a population of approximately 1.5 million inhabitants.
- The primary crime type analyzed is residential burglaries, which is the focus of the study.
- There is no mention of other crime types being analyzed in the study, so only residential burglaries are considered.","- The paper uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze burglary target selection, focusing on house-related attributes.
- The study includes data on 650 residential burglaries and approximately 500,000 residential properties in East Flanders.
- The total number of crime events analyzed is 650, as each unique burglar is associated with one burglary case.
- The number of unique offenders is also 650, as each burglar is counted once.
- The choice set is defined as every burglar choosing among 503,589 residential properties in East Flanders.

REASONING:

- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) used in the study is the ""census block group.""
- The size of each census block group is specified as "".14 square miles.""
- The description of the spatial units indicates that they are small areas typically bounded by streets, consistent with prior research on neighborhood context.
- The study includes a total of 653 census block groups.
- The average population per unit is given as 953 residents.
- The rationale for choosing this spatial scale is quoted as: ""Importantly, in a city context (as opposed to suburban or rural locales), a census block is generally a small area (typically a street-bounded block) and using this unit is consistent with prior work on the relationship between co-offending and neighbourhood context, which has relied on census tracts or blocks.""
- The rationale category is ""Prior research,"" as the choice is consistent with previous studies on similar topics.

- The sample size is indicated by the total number of arrests analyzed, which is 68,393.
- The number of crimes analyzed is specified as 6,249 incidents across census block groups.
- The number of offenders is not directly mentioned, but the number of arrested individuals involved in group crimes is given as 14,222.
- The choice set definition is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the choice sets are constructed based on the census block groups, as the study analyzes crime rates within these units.

- The data collection period is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the data was collected from the New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application (NIA) during the study period.
- The primary data source is the New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application (NIA).
- The data availability is limited as it is not publicly available and was obtained with specific approval from the New Zealand Police Research Panel.","- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) used in the study is the ""Statistical Area 2"" (SA2), which is a type of administrative unit.

- The number of units is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that there are multiple SA2s used in the study.
- The rationale for choosing SA2s includes their comparability to units used in other studies and the need to balance theoretical relevance, spatial spill-over, spatial heterogeneity, and computational processing.
- The justification category is a mix of prior research and practical constraint, as the choice is influenced by both the comparability to other studies and the practical considerations of data analysis.","- The study was conducted in New Zealand, as indicated by multiple references to the country in the context of the study.
- The study does not specify a particular city or region within New Zealand, suggesting a national scope.

- The study area description is provided as SA2s, which are comparable to neighborhoods and contain a specific number of residents.
- The primary crime types analyzed include residential burglaries, non-residential burglaries, commercial robberies, personal robberies, and extra-familial sex offences.","- The sampling approach used was a stratified importance sampling method, which is a technique to select a subset of alternatives that are representative of the larger set.
- The sample size refers to the number of choice observations or events, which in this case is the total number of crime incidents analyzed: 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences.
- The number of crimes analyzed is the sum of these incidents: 17,054 + 10,353 + 1,977 + 4,315 + 4,421 = 38,120.
- The number of offenders is approximately 60,000 after data cleaning.
- The choice set definition involves including the chosen SA2, SA2s with activity nodes within 5 km, and 10 randomly selected SA2s from those more than 5 km away.
- Alternative selection was based on a stratified importance sampling approach to ensure a manageable set of alternatives for each offender.
- Sample restrictions include only using nodes dated within 5 years of the reference offence and excluding certain types of offenses and records that did not reliably establish the presence of the offender.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,exact_normalized
