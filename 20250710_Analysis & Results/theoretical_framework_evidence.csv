  - ""The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crime-illicit drug dealing in an open air drug market-and tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands.""
  - ""Following prior work on retail drug markets (e.g., Eck, 1995;Rengert, 1996), our theoretical perspective combines elements from economics and criminology.""
  - ""The two main features that distinguish our study from prior work on the geography of drug dealing are the detailed spatial scale of analysis and the emphasis on multiple methods.""
  - ""The aim of the present study is to find out what affects street dealers' choices about where to solicit customers and make sales.""
  - ""What are the selection criteria that guide their choices? Are they attracted by the availability of potential customers? Are they deterred by formal and informal social control?""
  - ""The extant theoretical and empirical literature on criminal location choices (e.g., Bernasco, Block, & Ruiter, 2013) is primarily concerned with predatory crimes such as burglary and robbery, that is, crimes in which one party (the offender) wins something that the other party (the victim) loses.""

Using data on nearly 13,000 robberies, on the approximately 18,000 offenders involved in these robberies, and on the nearly 25,000 census blocks in the city of Chicago, we utilize the discrete choice framework to assess which criteria motivate the location decisions of street robbers.""
  - ""Choosing an economic approach to tackle these issues implies that we study the choice of where to commit a robbery as incentive-driven behavior that is comparable to other forms of economic and geographic human behavior, and can fruitfully be subjected to the same type of rigorous economic analysis as more common types of behavior.""
  - ""The discrete choice framework describes the behavior of a decision-maker who must choose an alternative from a finite set of alternatives that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.""
  - ""The question that inspires our research is not whether someone commits a robbery. We take for granted that there exist people who are mentally and physically prepared to act violently and break the law to obtain what they want. The question is where they do it, and why they do it there and not somewhere else.""
  - ""In this article, we introduce three major advances over prior work on crime location choice.""
  - ""Whereas it is crucial to understand what it is that attracts robbers, it is equally important to know what deters them. Possible factors include law enforcement activity (e.g. patrol intensity and investigative efficiency of the police that influence the risk of arrest), victim vigilance (e.g. hired private security personnel around businesses) and criminal competition (e.g. gangs violently dominating the local area). Our data did not contain appropriate localized measures of factors that could potentially deter robbers and force them to choose alternative robbery locations.""",,8

  - ""This hypothesis is inspired by a rational choice perspective on crime.""
  - ""Rational choice theory, however, is not the only theory predicting temporal variability in where crime takes place. Routine activity theory (Cohen and Felson 1979) emphasizes that the convergence of offenders and targets in both space and time is a necessary requirement for predatory crime.""
