**Title**: "Choosing the right pond: Spatial clustering of graffiti forms in urban environments" [REVISED TITLE]

Dear Editor and Reviewers,

We thank you for the thorough and constructive reviews of our manuscript. The reviewers raised important concerns about our theoretical framework, methodological assumptions, and lack of community engagement that have led us to substantially revise our approach. We believe these revisions have significantly strengthened the paper and address the core issues raised.

## MAJOR REVISIONS OVERVIEW

Based on the reviewer feedback, we have made the following major changes:

1. **Reframed theoretical approach** from "aesthetic quality hierarchy" to "functional complexity spectrum"
2. **Conducted sensitivity analysis** excluding stencils to address street art inclusion concerns
3. **Repositioned risk calibration** as the primary explanatory mechanism
4. **Acknowledged community engagement limitations** prominently throughout
5. **Added visual documentation** and local context for Ghent
6. **Expanded literature review** with suggested ethnographic sources

## DETAILED RESPONSES TO REVIEWER COMMENTS

### REVIEWER 1

#### Comment 1: Misconception of Aesthetic Hierarchies
> "The authors base much of their analysis on a presumed hierarchy of aesthetic quality among graffiti styles..."

**Response**: We acknowledge this fundamental criticism and thank the reviewer for this important cultural correction. We have completely reframed our theoretical approach.

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced "aesthetic quality" with "aesthetic complexity" throughout manuscript
- Added citations to Chastanet, Baldini, and other graffiti culture scholars
- Acknowledged that tags can represent sophisticated artistic expression
- Revised hypothesis to focus on functional differences rather than hierarchical quality
- **See**: Revised Introduction (p. 2-3), Theory section (p. 4-6), and Discussion (p. 12-14)

#### Comment 2: Inappropriate Inclusion of Street Art
> "The inclusion of stencils and other forms of street art in the dataset is a critical flaw."

**Response**: We conducted a sensitivity analysis to address this concern.

**Changes Made**:
- Re-ran all analyses excluding stencils from SITS category
- Created separate results for traditional graffiti only (tags, throw-ups, pieces)
- Present results both with and without stencils to demonstrate robustness
- Added methodological note acknowledging need for community validation
- **See**: New Table 2, Figure 2, and Methods section (p. 7-8)

**Key Finding**: Results remain statistically significant even when excluding stencils, suggesting clustering occurs within traditional graffiti forms.

#### Comment 3: Risk as Primary Determinant
> "High-risk areas typically attract tags; medium-risk areas may allow for throw-ups; low-risk areas are suitable for pieces."

**Response**: We now present risk calibration as the primary explanatory mechanism.

**Changes Made**:
- Added risk calibration theory to introduction and theory sections
- Reframed clustering as primarily driven by site suitability and risk tolerance
- Present aesthetic considerations as secondary factor
- Added limitation regarding unmeasured risk factors
- **See**: Revised Theory section (p. 4-6) and Discussion (p. 12-15)

#### Comment 4: Lack of Ethnographic Engagement
> "the absence of any engagement with the local graffiti community"

**Response**: We acknowledge this as our study's most significant limitation.

**Changes Made**:
- Moved community engagement limitation to prominent position in introduction
- Added acknowledgment throughout paper where community input would have been valuable
- Made claims more tentative regarding writer motivations
- Added detailed future research recommendations for community collaboration
- **See**: Introduction (p. 3), Methods limitations (p. 8), Discussion (p. 15-16)

### REVIEWER 2

#### Comment 1: Methodological Approach
> "the methodological approach is not really measuring what it is supposed to"

**Response**: We have reframed what our methodology actually measures.

**Changes Made**:
- Repositioned study as examining spatial clustering of graffiti forms rather than aesthetic quality per se
- Acknowledged limitations of visual categorization without community validation
- Added discussion of what our data can and cannot tell us about writer motivations
- **See**: Methods section (p. 7-8) and Discussion (p. 12-13)

#### Comment 2: Scientific References
> "there is not enough scientific references used"

**Response**: We have substantially expanded our literature review.

**Changes Made**:
- Added all suggested references: Chamberlain et al. (2022), Ross (Ed.) Routledge handbook, Zaimakis et al.
- Included additional graffiti culture, spatial analysis, and criminological sources
- Integrated new perspectives throughout theoretical framework
- **See**: Expanded Reference list (now 45 sources vs. previous 25)

#### Comment 3: Visual Documentation
> "very surprised not to see any photos of the graffiti data itself"

**Response**: We have added photographic documentation.

**Changes Made**:
- Added Figure 1 with representative photos of each graffiti category
- Included discussion of visual categorization in methods
- Added acknowledgment of subjective nature of visual classification
- **See**: New Figure 1 (p. 6) and enhanced Methods (p. 7-8)

### REVIEWER 3

#### Comment 1: Theoretical Context
> "Spot theory is originally based on Ferrell's ethnographic research on the male-dominated graffiti subculture in Denver..."

**Response**: We have added cultural and geographic context.

**Changes Made**:
- Added discussion of spot theory's cultural and geographic origins
- Included information about Ghent's graffiti policies and enforcement context
- Acknowledged potential gender biases in graffiti research
- Cited more diverse perspectives on graffiti motivation
- **See**: Theory section (p. 4-5) and Methods context (p. 7)

#### Comment 2: Alternative Hypothesis
> "if the hypothesis is formulated right or if, for example the hypothesis presented on p. 15 is more fit"

**Response**: We have adopted site suitability as our primary hypothesis.

**Changes Made**:
- Revised primary hypothesis to focus on differential site requirements
- Present risk tolerance and site suitability as main drivers
- Position aesthetic considerations as secondary factor
- Better align with spatial ecology literature
- **See**: Revised Abstract, Introduction (p. 2-3), and Theory (p. 4-6)

## NEW CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER REVISION

Our revised paper makes the following contributions:

1. **Methodological**: Demonstrates application of ecological indices to urban subcultures while acknowledging cultural limitations
2. **Empirical**: Shows robust spatial clustering patterns across different analytical approaches
3. **Theoretical**: Integrates risk calibration theory with spatial analysis of subcultural practices
4. **Policy**: Suggests more nuanced approaches to graffiti management that consider functional differences

---

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF LIMITATIONS

We now prominently acknowledge several limitations:

1. **Cultural Understanding**: Lack of community engagement limits interpretation of findings
2. **Causal Mechanisms**: Cannot definitively distinguish between risk-based and aesthetic explanations
3. **Geographic Specificity**: Single-city study limits generalizability
4. **Temporal Dynamics**: Cross-sectional data misses order of graffiti creation

---

## FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

Based on reviewer feedback, we suggest:

1. **Community-Engaged Research**: Collaborative studies with graffiti practitioners
2. **Risk Factor Analysis**: Explicit measurement of surveillance, enforcement, site characteristics
3. **Longitudinal Studies**: Tracking graffiti creation and removal over time
4. **Cross-Cultural Comparison**: Testing patterns across different urban contexts

---

## CONCLUSION

The reviewer feedback has been invaluable in helping us develop a more culturally informed and methodologically robust approach. While maintaining our core empirical contribution (spatial clustering patterns), we now present findings within a framework that respects subcultural knowledge and acknowledges alternative explanations. We believe this revised approach makes a meaningful contribution to understanding spatial patterns in urban subcultures while avoiding cultural misrepresentation.

We thank the reviewers for their expertise and hope that our substantial revisions address their concerns adequately.

Sincerely,
