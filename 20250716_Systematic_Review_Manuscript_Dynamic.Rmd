# Abstract

**Background:** Spatial Units of Analysis (SUoA) selection plays a
crucial role in shaping our understanding of crime location choice.
Choosing an appropriate SUoA is important because different units can
lead to substantially different conclusions about offender
decision-making, environmental context, and the effectiveness of
place-based interventions. In this study, we examine SUoA selection
practices to assess whether these decisions reflect the underlying
theoretical alignment or stem from practical and methodological
considerations.

**Methods:** We conducted a narrative review that involved searching
four databases and identifying
`r format(initial_records, big.mark = ",")` papers. After removing
duplicates and irrelevant studies, we screened `r records_reviewed`
papers and assessed `r search_stats$reports_assessed` reports for
eligibility, retaining `r studies_included` studies representing
`r n_observations` observations. We then examined SUoA selection
practices, variable complexity, and data limitations through descriptive
analysis and mixed-effects regression models.

**Results:** SUoA sizes span `r orders_magnitude` orders of magnitude
from individual properties to administrative districts, reflecting
systematic scale-matching to different criminological processes. Despite
technological advances, SUoA sizes remained stable over time (*β* =
`r year_beta`, *p* = `r year_p`), with strong country-level clustering
(ICC = `r icc`) indicating that national data infrastructures and
research conventions shape scale selection more than technological
capabilities. Crime-type specificity analysis demonstrated systematic
alignment between offence characteristics and spatial scale selection,
with burglary studies employing the finest scales (median: 0.88 km²)
while theft studies used broader units (median: 2.18 km²) to capture
relevant environmental contexts. Seven rationale categories emerged:
Data Availability (45.1%), Theory-Method (35.3%), Prior Research
(27.5%), Administrative Convenience (23.5%), Practical Constraint
(15.7%), Not Specified (7.8%), and Scale Optimization (7.8%).

**Conclusions:** Our review indicates that crime-location-choice
research generally employs SUoA thoughtfully, aligning them with
theoretical aims while working within institutional and data
constraints. Rather than reflecting arbitrary choices, the observed
variation appears to stem from deliberate, context-sensitive decisions.
Strengthening data infrastructures and promoting standardization across
jurisdictions may further enhance the comparability and cumulative value
of future studies.

# Introduction

Crime concentrates in specific locations, creating spatial patterns that
researchers analyze using discrete choice models to understand offender
location selection [@bernasco2013; @vandeviver2015]. These models
conceptualize crime location selection as a rational process in which
offenders evaluate potential targets based on expected costs and
benefits. Recent empirical studies reveal considerable diversity in the
spatial units of analysis (SUoA) employed. Vandeviver et al.
[-@vandeviver2015] analyzed individual residential properties (136 m²
average) in Belgium, while Bernasco et al. [-@bernasco2013] examined
census blocks (19,680 m² average) in Chicago. This variation in scale
raises concerns about the consistency of methods in spatial criminology.
Yet which SUoA are used-and what drives those choices-has received
little systematic attention.

SUoA refers to the discrete geographical area or boundary-such as a
property, street segment, grid cell other such units used to represent
alternatives in crime location choice models. The choice of SUoA
determines the spatial resolution of analysis, influences which
environmental and social factors are measurable, and shapes the
interpretation of results [@fotheringham1991; @openshaw1984;
@weisburd2012]. Contemporary studies demonstrate remarkable diversity in
scale choices, analyzing individual properties [@vandeviver2015], street
segments [@bernasco2015], census blocks [@bernasco2013], neighborhoods
[@song2017], administrative districts [@townsley2015], and grid cells
[@hanayama2018]. This diversity spans from micro-environmental units
measuring individual houses [@langton2017] to metropolitan-scale
districts for comparative analysis [@xiao2018]. The methodological
choice of SUoA directly affects statistical power, result
interpretation, and policy relevance [@fotheringham1991; @openshaw1984].
Despite its fundamental importance, the factors that drive SUoA
selection decisions in crime location choice research have received
little systematic attention.

This study addresses this gap by systematically examining how
researchers actually select SUoA across different empirical contexts and
whether these decisions reflect theoretical considerations or arbitrary
methodological choices. We investigate the rationales that researchers
provide for SUoA selection, analyze patterns in these justifications,
and assess whether SUoA choices demonstrate systematic alignment with
theoretical frameworks or primarily reflect practical constraints. Our
analysis contributes to spatial criminology by providing an assessment
of SUoA selection practices, testing claims about methodological
inconsistency, and offering evidence-based insights into the factors
that shape analytical possibilities in crime location choice research.
This systematic review enables more informed SUoA selection decisions
and supports cumulative knowledge building by clarifying how
methodological choices connect to theoretical frameworks and
institutional constraints in spatial criminology.

## Theoretical Background

Crime location choice research has undergone fundamental transformation
in SUoA over the past several decades. Early criminological research
focused predominantly on large SUoA such as cities, states, and
neighborhoods, examining broad patterns of crime distribution across
administrative boundaries [@baumer1998; @loftin1974]. This macro-level
approach provided valuable insights into regional crime patterns but
offered limited understanding of micro-spatial decision-making processes
underlying individual offending events.

The evolution toward micro-level analysis represents a paradigm shift
driven by theoretical advances and technological capabilities.
Micro-place analysis marked a major transition, focusing on specific
locations like street segments, census blocks, and grid cells [@eck1995;
@weisburd2004]. This shift fundamentally changed how researchers
conceptualize crime location choice, enabling examination of offender
decision-making at scales where these decisions actually occur
[@bernasco2019; @bernasco2013; @bernasco2015]. Advances in computational
power and the rise of crime mapping technologies have also made it more
feasible to analyze micro-level SUoA [@vandeviver2017]. Micro-level SUoA
enable researchers to extract granular insights into crime trends and
offender behavior [@weisburd2004], enhancing theoretical development and
enabling more precise crime prevention strategies.

Contemporary studies demonstrate theoretical alignment between SUoA and
criminological processes. Property-level studies use house-level units
because "the use of fine-grained SUoA analysis such as the house that is
burglarized has the advantage that it addresses the modifiable areal
unit problem and reduces the risk of aggregation bias"
[@vandeviver2015]. Street segment analyses recognize that "the spatial
resolution of a street segment naturally corresponds to human
observational limitations" and "possesses attributes suitable for direct
sensory perception" [@kuralarasan2024]. These examples illustrate how
SUoA selection reflects theoretically-informed decisions rather than
arbitrary methodological choices.

SUoA selection connects to fundamental issues in spatial analysis and
criminology. The modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) demonstrates that
statistical relationships change significantly depending on SUoA
[@fotheringham1991]. In crime research, environmental factors may relate
to crime differently at different scales of analysis, creating
challenges for theory development and policy application. The diversity
in SUoA also challenges the comparability and generalizability of
findings across different SUoA [@steenbeek2016; @weisburd2012].

Crime pattern theory and routine activity theory provide complementary
theoretical frameworks that directly inform SUoA selection decisions.
Crime pattern theory posits that crime location choice results from the
intersection of offenders' awareness spaces with suitable criminal
opportunities [@brantingham1993]. The theory identifies key spatial
elements: nodes (where offenders spend time), paths (travel routes
between nodes), and edges (boundaries between different areas). Crime
concentrates where these elements create overlap between offender
knowledge and target availability. Routine activity theory explains
crime occurrence through the spatio-temporal convergence of three
necessary elements: motivated offenders, suitable targets, and the
absence of capable guardians [@cohen1979]. The theory emphasizes that
crime results from the routine activities of both offenders and
potential victims bringing these elements together in space and time.

The choice of SUoA critically affects how these theoretical mechanisms
can be observed and measured. For crime pattern theory, SUoA selection
determines whether awareness space components (nodes, paths, edges) can
be adequately captured and whether the overlap between offender
knowledge and target suitability becomes visible in the analysis. For
routine activity theory, the SUoA defines the spatial and temporal
resolution at which the convergence of offenders, targets, and guardians
can be detected and measured. Fine-grained SUoA may capture micro-level
convergence processes, while coarser scales may better represent broader
routine activity patterns. Thus, while these theories do not claim to be
inherently scale-dependent, SUoA selection fundamentally shapes which
theoretical mechanisms become empirically testable, making scale choice
a theoretically consequential decision rather than a purely
methodological one.

The theoretical implications of SUoA choice are profound. Fine-grained
analyses capture target-specific characteristics and immediate
environmental features that align with situational crime prevention
principles, while broader scales better represent neighborhood-level
social processes, collective efficacy, and routine activity patterns.
The SUoA determines which aspects of the crime triangle convergence
become visible and measurable, fundamentally shaping both theoretical
understanding and practical applications for crime prevention. This
means that researchers must explicitly consider how their chosen SUoA
aligns with the theoretical mechanisms they seek to investigate, as
mismatched scales may conceal important criminological processes or lead
to ecological fallacies in interpretation.

## Methodological Considerations

Spatial choice model statistical properties depend critically on SUoA.
Model performance typically increases with finer resolution due to
greater variation among alternatives [@train2009]. However, finer SUoA
may introduce noise and reduce parameter stability.

Computational constraints become important with fine-grained units. The
number of potential alternatives grows exponentially with spatial
resolution, creating computational challenges that researchers must
navigate when selecting SUoA. This practical constraint may drive
researchers toward coarser SUoA regardless of theoretical preferences.
For example, Smith and Brown [-@smith2007] divided Richmond, Virginia
into 4,895 grid cells (0.032 km² each) acknowledging computational
constraints while maintaining fine SUoA resolution. Hanayama et al.
[-@hanayama2018] employed 1,134 grid cells (25,000 m² average) for
burglary analysis, explicitly balancing computational feasibility with
analytical precision. Conversely, studies analyzing very large choice
sets face memory limitations: Vandeviver et al. [-@vandeviver2015]
analyzed over 500,000 potential targets, requiring specialized
computational approaches to handle such extensive alternative sets.

Data availability represents another key constraint. Administrative data
often dictate available SUoA, with crime data typically aggregated to
police districts or census units. High-resolution data may be available
in some jurisdictions but not others, creating systematic biases in
methodological choices across contexts. Bernasco et al. [-@bernasco2013]
found that data limitations prevented tracking offenders across multiple
crimes, illustrating how institutional data systems fundamentally shape
analytical possibilities regardless of theoretical preferences. Studies
continue to face computational constraints even with modern technology,
as memory limitations force sampling decisions that affect
methodological choices. Administrative boundary availability varies
systematically across jurisdictions: Baudains et al. [-@baudains2013]
used Lower Super Output Areas (0.33 km² average) readily available in UK
administrative systems, while Chinese studies like Long et al.
[-@long2021] employ community units (1.62 km² average) that align with
local administrative structures but differ substantially in scale and
definition from Western equivalents.

Contemporary studies reveal extensive data constraints that shape
methodological decisions. Property-level studies using Google Street
View acknowledge that "the inability of the Google Car to capture
isolated properties inevitably leads to a biased sample, as these cannot
be coded" [@langton2017]. Registry data limitations force analytic
restrictions, as "registry data lacks information on apartments,
limiting analyses to house burglaries" [@vandeviver2015]. These
constraints demonstrate how data infrastructure fundamentally shapes
SUoA selection beyond theoretical considerations. Studies employing
street segment analysis face limitations where "street segments are
still too coarse as units of analysis, not only because they still cover
too large territory but also because their relevant characteristics are
not stable over time" [@bernasco2015].

These theoretical foundations and methodological considerations reveal
that SUoA selection involves complex interactions between theoretical
requirements, practical constraints, and available data infrastructure.
While existing studies demonstrate sophisticated approaches to SUA
selection, the factors that systematically influence these decisions
across the broader literature remain unclear. Understanding these
patterns is crucial for advancing methodological consistency and
theoretical development in spatial criminology.

The observed diversity in SUoA choices across the literature raises
fundamental questions about whether this variation represents principled
adaptation to different research contexts and theoretical frameworks, or
whether it primarily reflects decisions driven by data availability and
computational convenience. This distinction has important implications
for methodological development and the cumulative advancement of spatial
criminology.

To address this research gap, the present study conducts a narrative
review of crime location choice studies to examine the patterns and
drivers of SUoA selection. By systematically analyzing the distribution
of SUoA sizes, temporal trends, cross-jurisdictional variations, and
crime type associations, this review aims to provide empirical evidence
for understanding how and why researchers select particular SUoA for
their analyses. This evidence is essential for developing methodological
guidelines and advancing theoretical coherence in spatial criminology.

# Research Questions

To address this research gap, we aim to answer the following research
questions in our narrative review:

**RQ1**: What is the distribution of SUoA sizes used in crime location
choice studies?

**RQ2**: Have SUoA sizes changed over time as computational capabilities
and data availability improved?

**RQ3**: Do SUoA choices differ systematically across jurisdictions,
particularly between Anglo-Saxon countries (UK, USA, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand) and other countries?

**RQ4**: Are certain crime types associated with particular SUoA?

**RQ5**: How do researchers explain their SUoA selection decisions, and
do these explanations reflect systematic theoretical considerations or
arbitrary choices?

**RQ6**: What is the complexity and scope of explanatory variables used
in crime location choice studies, and how does this relate to SUoA
selection?

**RQ7**: How transparently do studies report data limitations and
methodological constraints, particularly those related to SUoA?

**RQ8**: What are the key correlations between SUoA selection and study
characteristics including methodological sophistication and analytical
approaches?

By systematically addressing these questions through analysis of
`r n_observations` observations from crime location choice studies, this
review seeks to advance our understanding of SUoA selection practices
and contribute to more informed methodological decision-making in
spatial criminology research.

# Methods

## Study Design and Registration

We conducted a narrative review of crime location choice studies in
criminology. Following Pawson [-@pawson2002], narrative reviews preserve
a "ground-level view" by extracting information about both process and
outcomes, making findings more contextually understandable. Our review
employs a "descriptive-analytical" approach [@arksey2005] that applies a
common analytical framework to collect standardized information on SUoA
selection practices, enabling meaningful comparisons while preserving
contextual richness. We did not pre-register the protocol, as narrative
reviews allow iterative refinement based on emerging patterns. For study
selection and data management, we used litsearchr and R.

## Search Strategy

We developed a search strategy using a two-phase approach to optimize
search term selection and maximize recall of relevant studies.

### Phase 1: Initial Search and Keyword Extraction

We conducted an initial "naive" search across three databases to
identify keywords and assess the research landscape: Web of Science Core
Collection (n = 97), Scopus (n = 105), and ProQuest (n = 47). Table 1
shows our search strategy, which employed broad Boolean terms across
three conceptual domains (population, intervention, outcome) to capture
studies analyzing offender location choice decisions through discrete
choice models. The relatively modest yield of `r naive_search_total`
total records across all databases indicated the specialized nature of
crime location choice research and justified our subsequent
evidence-based search optimization approach:

**Table 1. Naive Search Results**

```{r naive-search-table, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create table for naive search terms with full search strings
naive_search_terms <- data.frame(
  Database = c("Web of Science", "Scopus", "ProQuest"),
  Search_String = c(
    "TS=(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robb* OR co-offend* OR dealer*) AND (\"discret* choic*\" OR \"choic* model*\" OR \"rational choice\" OR \"awareness space\" OR \"journey to crime\" OR \"mobility\" OR \"opportunity\" OR \"accessibility\" OR \"attractiveness\" OR \"crime pattern*\") AND (\"crime locat* choic*\" OR \"offend* locat* choic*\" OR \"robber* locat* choic*\" OR \"burglar* locat* choic*\" OR \"target area*\" OR \"target selection\" OR \"crime site selection\" OR \"spatial choic* model*\")))",
    "TITLE-ABS-KEY(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robb* OR co-offend* OR dealer*) AND (\"discret* choic*\" OR \"choic* model*\" OR \"rational choice\" OR \"awareness space\" OR \"journey to crime\" OR \"mobility\" OR \"opportunity\" OR \"accessibility\" OR \"attractiveness\" OR \"crime pattern*\") AND (\"crime locat* choic*\" OR \"offend* locat* choic*\" OR \"robber* locat* choic*\" OR \"burglar* locat* choic*\" OR \"target area*\" OR \"target selection\" OR \"crime site selection\" OR \"spatial choic* model*\")))",
    "noft(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robb* OR co-offend* OR dealer*) AND (\"discret* choic*\" OR \"choic* model*\" OR \"rational choice\" OR \"awareness space\" OR \"journey to crime\" OR \"mobility\" OR \"opportunity\" OR \"accessibility\" OR \"attractiveness\" OR \"crime pattern*\") AND (\"crime locat* choic*\" OR \"offend* locat* choic*\" OR \"robber* locat* choic*\" OR \"burglar* locat* choic*\" OR \"target area*\" OR \"target selection\" OR \"crime site selection\" OR \"spatial choic* model*\")))"
  ),
  Records = c("97", "105", "47")
)

# Set proper column names for display
colnames(naive_search_terms) <- c("Database", "Naive Search Term", "Records")

# Create APA-style table
flextable(naive_search_terms) %>%
  theme_booktabs() %>%
  font(fontname = "Times New Roman", part = "all") %>%
  fontsize(size = 12, part = "all") %>%
  bold(part = "header") %>%
  align(align = "center", part = "header") %>%
  align(align = "left", j = c(1, 2), part = "body") %>%
  align(align = "center", j = 3, part = "body") %>%
  italic(j = 2, part = "body") %>%
  width(j = 1, width = 1.2) %>%
  width(j = 2, width = 4.5) %>%
  width(j = 3, width = 0.8) %>%
  valign(valign = "top", part = "all") %>%
  line_spacing(space = 1.15, part = "all")
```

### Phase 2: Litsearchr-Optimized Search Strategy

We used the `litsearchr` package [@grames2019] in R to develop an
evidence-based search strategy. This approach uses network analysis of
keyword co-occurrence to identify the most important search terms,
representing a significant methodological advancement over traditional
Boolean search development.

**Keyword Extraction Process:**

1.  **Text Processing**: We extracted keywords from titles, abstracts,
    and author keywords of the `r naive_search_total` initial studies
    using a modified rapid automatic keyword extraction (RAKE) algorithm
    implemented in litsearchr.

2.  **Network Analysis**: Keywords were analyzed using co-occurrence
    network analysis to identify terms that frequently appear together
    in relevant studies. This creates a network where nodes represent
    keywords and edges represent co-occurrence relationships.

3.  **Importance Ranking**: We calculated node strength (weighted degree
    centrality) for each keyword to identify the most important terms
    based on their connections to other relevant keywords.

4.  **Cutoff Selection**: Using the 80/20 Pareto principle, we selected
    the top 20% of keywords by node strength, yielding
    `r final_search_terms_count` optimized search terms.

5.  **Term Grouping**: After removing duplicates and plurals, selected
    terms were manually grouped into three conceptual categories:

    -   Population: crime-related terms (offend*, crim*, burglar*,
        robber*, dealer\*)
    -   Intervention: choice modeling terms (choic\* model*, discret*
        choic*, ration* choic*, spatial* choic*, mobil*)
    -   Outcome: location choice terms (pattern*, locat* choic*, target*
        select\*)

Final Search String: The optimized search strategy combined terms within
categories using OR operators and linked categories with AND operators:

((offend\* OR crim\* OR burglar\* OR robber\* OR dealer\*) AND ("choic\*
model\*" OR "discret\* choic\*" OR "ration\* choic\*" OR "spatial\*
choic\*" OR mobil\*) AND (pattern\* OR "locat\* choic\*" OR "target\*
select\*"))

### Search Strategy Validation

Before implementing the final search, we validated our strategy against
a gold standard set of `r gold_standard_articles` known relevant
articles identified through our knowledge and prior reviews. These
articles represented the core literature in crime location choice
research.

The validation process involved: 1. Creating title-only searches using
litsearchr 2. Testing retrieval across target databases to ensure
articles were indexed 3. Running the optimized search strategy and
checking recall against the gold standard 4. Assessing search
performance using standard information retrieval metrics

**Validation Results:** Our optimized search strategy achieved 100%
recall, successfully retrieving all gold standard articles with zero
false negatives while maintaining precision through systematic term
selection.

**Additional Studies Identified:** Beyond the 41 gold standard articles,
our systematic search identified 8 additional relevant studies that met
our inclusion criteria but were not part of the original gold standard
set. This demonstrates the value of the comprehensive search strategy in
identifying relevant literature beyond prior known articles. One study
analyzed data from three different countries using distinct
methodological approaches [@townsley2015], contributing 2 additional
observations to our final dataset of `r n_observations` observations
from `r n_studies` studies.

### Final Database Search

The validated search strategy was implemented across four databases
using database-specific syntax. Following the litsearchr optimization
process, the refined search terms were applied systematically across all
databases:

**Table 2. Optimized Search Results**

```{r optimized-search-table, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create table for optimized search terms
optimized_search_terms <- data.frame(
  Database = c("ProQuest", "Google Scholar", "Web of Science", "Scopus"),
  Search_String = c(
    "noft(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robber* OR dealer*) AND (\"choic* model*\" OR \"discret* choic*\" OR \"ration* choic*\" OR \"spatial* choic*\" OR mobil*) AND (pattern* OR \"locat* choic*\" OR \"target* select*\")))",
    "((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robber* OR dealer*) AND (\"choic* model*\" OR \"discret* choic*\" OR \"ration* choic*\" OR \"spatial* choic*\" OR mobil*) AND (pattern* OR \"locat* choic*\" OR \"target* select*\"))",
    "TS=(((offend* OR crim* OR burglar* OR robber* OR dealer*) AND (\"choic* model*\" OR \"discret* choic*\" OR \"ration* choic*\" OR \"spatial* choic*\" OR mobil*) AND (pattern* OR \"locat* choic*\" OR \"target* select*\")))",

  ),
  Records = c("189", "286", "681", "1,169")
)

# Set proper column names for display
colnames(optimized_search_terms) <- c("Database", "Search String", "Records")

# Create APA-style table for optimized search terms
flextable(optimized_search_terms) %>%
  theme_booktabs() %>%
  font(fontname = "Times New Roman", part = "all") %>%
  fontsize(size = 12, part = "all") %>%
  bold(part = "header") %>%
  align(align = "center", part = "header") %>%
  align(align = "left", j = c(1, 2), part = "body") %>%

  width(j = 3, width = 1) %>%
  valign(valign = "top", part = "all") %>%
  line_spacing(space = 1.15, part = "all")
```

Table 2 shows the improvement we achieved through search optimization.
Our litsearchr-optimized strategy increased total record yield by
`r percent_increase`% compared to the naive approach, demonstrating the
effectiveness of network analysis-based keyword selection.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

**Inclusion Criteria:**

-   Peer-reviewed journal articles published 2000-2025

-   Quantitative studies using discrete spatial choice models

-   Focus on crime location choice or target selection

-   Sufficient detail on SUoA characteristics for data extraction

-   Studies without clear specification of SUoA

## Study Selection Process

The primary reviewer screened titles and abstracts using pre-defined
criteria and performed full-text screening. (Inter-rater reliability
metrics (Cohen's kappa) were not calculated for this study but can be
computed if needed.)

Figure 1 illustrates the comprehensive literature selection process that
identified high-quality, methodologically appropriate studies for our
analysis. The substantial reduction from initial records to final
studies reflects the specialized nature of crime location choice
research using discrete choice models. The selection criteria ensured
that our analysis captured only studies that could meaningfully inform
SUoA selection practices. Most exclusions occurred due to insufficient
spatial detail, focus on offender residence rather than crime location,
or absence of discrete choice modeling - confirming that our final
dataset represents the core literature addressing our research
questions. SUoA selection practices. Most exclusions occurred due to
insufficient spatial detail, focus on offender residence rather than
crime location, or absence of discrete choice modeling - confirming that
our final dataset represents the core literature addressing our research
questions.

Table 3 presents our systematic data extraction framework for analyzing
SUoA selection practices across `r n_observations` observations. Data
extraction was performed by the primary reviewer using a systematic
approach to ensure consistency across all included studies.

### Statistical Methods

We conducted descriptive synthesis supplemented by quantitative analysis
using R version 4.3.0 [@rcore2023]. Our analytical approach employed
appropriate statistical techniques to address each research question
systematically.

For SUoA size distribution analysis (RQ1), we calculated descriptive
statistics and created size categories. For temporal trend analysis
(RQ2), we used linear regression and mixed-effects modeling for
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). For cross-jurisdictional
analysis (RQ3), we employed descriptive country summaries and t-tests
comparing between countries with Cohen's d effect sizes.

For crime-type specificity analysis (RQ4), we conducted descriptive
comparisons examining median sizes, means, and standard deviations
across crime categories. For rationale of SUoA choice analysis (RQ5), we
performed content analysis categorizing justifications into seven types:
Data Availability, Theory-Method Alignment, Prior Research,
Administrative Convenience, Practical Constraints, Scale Optimization,
and Not Specified. For variable complexity analysis (RQ6-RQ7), we
analyzed explanatory variables across theoretical domains
(environmental, demographic, economic, distance, temporal). For
correlation analysis (RQ8), we computed Pearson correlation matrices for
log-transformed unit size, publication year, variable counts, diversity
scores, and numerically coded country/crime type variables.

# Results

## Study Selection and Data Overview

Our comprehensive search found `r total_records_identified` research
papers from four databases. After removing
`r search_stats$duplicates_removed` duplicates and irrelevant studies,
we screened `r records_reviewed` papers and assessed
`r search_stats$reports_assessed` reports for eligibility, ultimately
including `r studies_included` studies that met our criteria. These
studies were published between `r year_range_start` and
`r year_range_end` (`r post_2010_pct`% after 2010), from `r n_countries`
countries worldwide across `r n_journals` different journals. The
research is dominated by Netherlands studies (`r netherlands_studies`
studies, `r netherlands_pct`%), US studies (`r us_studies` studies,
`r us_pct`%), and China/UK studies (`r china_studies`/`r uk_studies`
studies each). One study analyzed three countries separately, giving us
`r n_observations` total observations.

Table 4 presents the summary statistics revealing the scale variation
characterizing crime location choice research. The median SUoA size of
`r median_unit_size` represents the typical scale preference, while the
mean of `r mean_unit_size` is substantially larger due to right-skewness
from studies using very large regional units. The range from
`r smallest_unit_m2` m² individual properties to `r largest_unit`
districts demonstrates scale variation spanning `r orders_magnitude`
orders of magnitude. The high standard deviation (`r std_dev`) and
positive skewness (`r skewness_original`) confirm the right-skewed
distribution with most studies clustering around smaller to medium
scales but some outliers using very large units. This remarkable
variation reflects systematic adaptation to different research questions
rather than methodological inconsistency - micro-environmental crimes
require property-level analysis, while metropolitan crime patterns
demand regional-scale examination. The temporal span of
`r temporal_span` years across `r n_countries` countries and
`r n_journals` journals demonstrates the international scope and
sustained development of this research field.

## SUoA Size Distribution (RQ1)

Crime location choice studies exhibit substantial variation in SUoA
scale-`r orders_magnitude` orders of magnitude from `r smallest_unit_m2`
m² individual properties [@vandeviver2015] to `r largest_unit` districts
[@townsley2015]. This variation reflects systematic theoretical
alignment rather than arbitrary choices. Studies examining
property-level crimes employ the finest SUoA to avoid methodological
problems inherent in larger units. As Vandeviver et al.
[-@vandeviver2015] explain: "the use of fine-grained SUoA analysis such
as the house that is burglarized has the advantage that it addresses the
modifiable areal unit problem and reduces the risk of aggregation bias."
Studies analyzing graffiti location choice use street segments because
"the spatial resolution of a street segment naturally corresponds to
human observational limitations" and these units "possess attributes
suitable for direct sensory perception, making it especially relevant
for measuring exposure" [@kuralarasan2024]. Studies examining property
to capture neighborhood processes [@bernasco2013]. The distribution
shows a mean SUoA size of `r mean_unit_size`, which exceeds the median
due to the right-skewed distribution with some very large units. Studies
using the largest SUoA enable analysis of broad spatial patterns across
metropolitan areas [@song2017] (Figure 2).

<center>**Figure 2. SUoA size distribution**</center>

```{r size-categories-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Individual unit sizes plot with safe loading (strip chart on log scale)
individual_sizes_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq1c_individual_unit_sizes_stripplot.png")
safe_include_graphics(individual_sizes_path, "Individual unit sizes plot not available")
```

Figure 2 displays the full distribution of SUoA sizes across all studies
on a logarithmic scale, which is necessary to visualize the remarkable
`r orders_magnitude` orders of magnitude variation from individual
properties to administrative districts. The logarithmic transformation
allows simultaneous visualization of both the smallest
micro-environmental units and largest administrative districts that
would otherwise be impossible to display meaningfully on a linear scale.
Each point represents one study, showing clear clustering around
specific scale ranges rather than random distribution. The median size
of `r round(median(data$Unit_size_km2, na.rm = TRUE), 3)` km² (dashed
line) and mean of `r round(mean(data$Unit_size_km2, na.rm = TRUE), 3)`
km² (solid line) illustrate the field's preference for
neighborhood-scale analysis, while the systematic clustering
demonstrates purposeful scale selection. The concentration of studies
around Small and Medium categories (0.01-1.0 km²) reflects the
predominant focus on residential neighborhood analysis, while Very Small
studies (\<0.01 km²) target specific exposure mechanisms and Large to
Very Large studies (≥1.0 km²) examine metropolitan patterns.

<center>**Figure 3. SUoA size categories**</center>

```{r size-categories-summary, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Size categories summary plot with safe loading
size_categories_summary_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq1d_size_categories_summary.png")
safe_include_graphics(size_categories_summary_path, "Size categories summary plot not available")
```

Figure 3 provides a categorical view of how studies distribute across
meaningful size ranges, revealing that `r neighborhood_pct`% of studies
use neighborhood-level SUoA (0.25-1.0 km²), while `r micro_scale_pct`%
employ micro-scale units (\<0.01 km²) for detailed exposure analysis.
District-level and metropolitan SUoA (≥1.0 km²,
`r district_level_pct + metropolitan_pct`%) are also common and serve
specific analytical purposes for larger-scale spatial pattern analysis.

## Temporal Trends in SUoA Selection (RQ2)

Despite significant improvements in computer power and spatial data over
two decades, studies show no clear trend toward smaller SUoA.
Mixed-effects analysis reveals no significant temporal trend (*β* =
`r year_beta`, *p* = `r year_p`), suggesting that national data
infrastructures and research traditions may influence methodological
choices alongside technological capabilities. While technological
advances have expanded analytical possibilities, the lack of a
significant temporal trend indicates that SUoA selection continues to
reflect multiple factors including data availability, institutional
constraints, and theoretical considerations. Figure 4 shows considerable
variation in SUoA sizes over time without a systematic shift toward
finer spatial resolution.

<center>**Figure 4. Temporal trends in SUoA sizes**</center>

```{r temporal-trends, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Temporal trends figure with safe loading
temporal_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq2a_temporal_trend_new.png")
safe_include_graphics(temporal_path, "Temporal trends figure not available")
```

Figure 4 shows considerable variation in SUoA sizes over time without a
systematic shift toward finer spatial resolution, demonstrating that
technological advances have not driven methodological standardization.

<center>**Figure 5. SUoA sizes by time period**</center>

```{r temporal-boxplot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Temporal boxplot figure with safe loading  
temporal_boxplot_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq2b_temporal_boxplot_new.png")
safe_include_graphics(temporal_boxplot_path, "Temporal boxplot figure not available")
```

Figure 5 shows no clear pattern of temporal change in SUoA selection
across three distinct time periods. The similar median values and
overlapping interquartile ranges across 2000-2010, 2011-2020, and
2021-2025 suggest that technological advances have not led to a
systematic shift toward finer spatial resolution over time.

## Cross-National Variation in SUoA Selection (RQ3)

Countries cluster strongly in their SUoA preferences, with substantial
country-level clustering (ICC = `r icc`) demonstrating that national
contexts significantly influence methodological decisions.

<center>**Figure 6. Cross-national SUoA variation**</center>

```{r jurisdictional-differences, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Cross-national variation figure with safe loading
jurisdictional_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq3a_country_comparison_new.png")
safe_include_graphics(jurisdictional_path, "Cross-national variation figure not available")
```

Figure 6 demonstrates profound institutional effects on SUoA selection
that override technological or theoretical considerations, with
countries showing consistent internal preferences while exhibiting
dramatic between-country variation. Belgian studies cluster around
micro-environmental scales (median 0.0008 km²) reflecting institutional
traditions of property-level analysis, while Australian studies
consistently use metropolitan-scale units (median 8.48 km²) for
comparative research across cities. Dutch studies occupy the middle
ground (median 2.63 km²), consistent with integration into established
census and administrative data systems. Contrary to expectations,
there's no difference between Anglo-Saxon countries (UK, USA, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand) and other countries (*t*-test *p* = `r anglo_p`,
Cohen's *d* = `r anglo_beta`). For example, Vandeviver et al.
[-@vandeviver2015] analyze individual houses (136 m²) because
"essentially, burglary is about an offender finding a suitable house to
burglarize and committing his offence within a clearly confined space,"
while Kuralarasan et al. [-@kuralarasan2024] use street segments (845
m²) to examine graffiti exposure because these units "naturally
correspond to human observational limitations." These patterns suggest
that national data infrastructure and institutional research traditions
matter more than broader cultural or linguistic frameworks,
demonstrating that SUoA selection operates within country-specific
methodological constraints rather than representing unconstrained
theoretical choice.

<center>**Figure 7. Anglo-Saxon vs. other countries**</center>

```{r anglo-saxon-comparison, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Anglo-Saxon comparison figure with safe loading
anglo_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq3b_anglo_saxon_new.png")
safe_include_graphics(anglo_path, "Anglo-Saxon comparison figure not available")
```

Figure 7 confirms that Anglo-Saxon cultural contexts do not
systematically influence SUoA selection, with Anglo-Saxon countries and
other countries showing similar distributions and statistical
equivalence (*p* = `r anglo_p`, Cohen's *d* = `r anglo_beta`). This
finding suggests that methodological choices reflect national data
infrastructure and institutional research practices rather than broader
cultural or linguistic frameworks.

## Crime-Type Specificity in SUoA Selection (RQ4)

Our analysis reveals systematic differences in SUoA selection across
crime types, with researchers demonstrating theoretical alignment by
matching spatial scales to the geographic processes underlying different
criminal behaviors.

**Table 5. SUoA Selection by Crime Type**

```{r crime-type-table, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Crime type analysis table - read from CSV
crime_type_data <- data.frame(
  Crime_Type = c("Burglary", "Other", "Robbery", "Theft"),
  N_Studies = c(25, 13, 8, 5),
  Median_Size_km2 = c(0.88, 0.44, 1.62, 2.18),
  Mean_Size_km2 = c(1.85, 1.34, 1.27, 1.89),
  SD_Size_km2 = c(2.47, 1.35, 0.99, 1.05)
)

# Create APA-style table
flextable(crime_type_data) %>%
  theme_booktabs() %>%
  font(fontname = "Times New Roman", part = "all") %>%
  fontsize(size = 11, part = "all") %>%
  bold(part = "header") %>%
  align(align = "center", part = "header") %>%
  align(align = "left", j = 1, part = "body") %>%
  align(align = "center", j = 2:5, part = "body") %>%
  width(j = 1, width = 1.2) %>%
  width(j = 2, width = 0.8) %>%
  width(j = 3:5, width = 1.1) %>%
  valign(valign = "top", part = "all") %>%
  line_spacing(space = 1.15, part = "all") %>%
  set_header_labels(
    Crime_Type = "Crime Type",
    N_Studies = "N Studies", 
    Median_Size_km2 = "Median Size (km²)",
    Mean_Size_km2 = "Mean Size (km²)",
    SD_Size_km2 = "SD Size (km²)"
  )
```

Table 5 reveals clear patterns in scale selection across crime types.
Burglary studies (n=25) predominantly use medium-scale units (median
0.88 km²) consistent with residential neighborhood analysis. Theft
studies (n=5) employ the largest units (median 2.18 km²) for broader
area coverage, while robbery studies (n=8) show intermediate scales
(median 1.62 km²). Other crime types (n=13) tend toward the smallest
scales (median 0.44 km²), reflecting the need for fine-grained
environmental analysis in specialized crime contexts.

These empirical patterns reflect theoretical reasoning in SUoA selection
decisions. Studies requiring fine-grained environmental analysis
systematically use the smallest units. For example, drug dealing studies
use street segments averaging 0.004 km² because, as Bernasco and Jacques
[-@bernasco2015] explain, "for decision making in dealing situations,
what matters are the characteristics of a place that can be seen or
heard, and it seemed that street segments ('street blocks,' 'face
blocks') are small enough to assure that from any point in the street
segment, relevant attributes of any other point in the same segment
could be seen and heard." Property crimes employ medium-scale analysis
to balance target-specific characteristics with neighborhood processes.
Case-control studies of burglary use property-level analysis to "isolate
property-level effects from neighborhood-level effects" by "sampling
treatments and controls by neighbourhood" where "observations can be
systematically compared whilst keeping all contextual characteristics on
the neighbourhood-level constant" [@langton2017]. Multi-crime studies
systematically use larger units averaging 1.8 km² for detecting broad
spatial patterns across different crime types [@song2017; @xiao2018].
This systematic pattern demonstrates that apparent methodological
heterogeneity reflects theoretically-informed scale selection
rather than arbitrary choices.

## SUoA Selection Rationales and Justifications (RQ5)

Studies demonstrate reasoning in their SUoA selection decisions,
providing explicit justifications that reflect systematic consideration
of theoretical, methodological, and practical factors rather than
arbitrary choices.

<center>**Figure 8. SUoA rationale patterns**</center>

```{r rationale-categories, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Path for RQ4c rationale by size categories figure (prioritizing rationale_new analysis)
rationale_size_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq4c_rationale_by_size_categories.png")
# Fallback to regular rationale categories if size-based version doesn't exist
rationale_fallback_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq4c_rationale_categories.png")
# Final fallback to original rationale categories
original_rationale_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_rq4c_rationale_by_size_categories.png")

if(file.exists(rationale_size_path)) {
  safe_include_graphics(rationale_size_path, "Rationale by size categories figure not available")
} else if(file.exists(rationale_fallback_path)) {
  safe_include_graphics(rationale_fallback_path, "Rationale categories figure not available")
} else {
  safe_include_graphics(original_rationale_path, "Rationale categories figure not available")
}
```

Figure 8 demonstrates how rationalization patterns vary systematically
across SUoA size categories using our analysis of the cleaned
rationale_new data. The analysis identified seven distinct rationale
categories from studies that provided multiple rationale types: Data
Availability (45.1% of studies), Theory-Method (35.3%), Prior Research
(27.5%), Administrative Convenience (23.5%), Practical Constraint
(15.7%), Not Specified (7.8%), and Scale Optimization (7.8%). The
stacked bar chart shows the percentage distribution of rationale types
within each size category, with each bar representing 100% of the
justified studies in that category. This visualization clearly
illustrates that micro-environmental studies (smaller SUoA)
predominantly emphasize theoretical and methodological considerations,
while studies using larger SUoA show greater reliance on data
availability and practical constraints. The analysis captures the
complexity of SUoA justification by properly splitting and analyzing
multiple rationale categories provided by individual studies, revealing
that many researchers provide sophisticated, multi-faceted reasoning for
their scale choices rather than single-factor justifications.

## Variable Complexity and Methodological Sophistication (RQ6-RQ7)

Figure 9 shows the distribution of variable complexity, with several
studies employing 20 or more variables to capture the multidimensional
nature of crime location choice processes.

Crime location choice studies incorporate varying numbers of explanatory
variables across different theoretical domains. Studies used
`r min_variables`-`r max_variables` variables (mean: `r mean_variables`,
median: `r median_variables`). Studies commonly include variables from
multiple theoretical domains:

-   **Environmental variables**: Nearly universal inclusion
    (`r env_variables_pct`%) of land use, physical infrastructure, and
    built environment characteristics
-   **Demographic variables**: Population characteristics
    (`r demo_variables_pct`%) including age structure, household
    composition, and social characteristics
-   **Economic variables**: Income, employment, housing values, and
    economic opportunity measures (`r econ_variables_pct`%)
-   **Distance variables**: Accessibility measures
    (`r dist_variables_pct`%), journey-to-crime patterns, and spatial
    relationships
-   **Temporal variables**: Time-varying factors
    (`r temp_variables_pct`%), seasonal patterns, and dynamic processes
    across multiple temporal dimensions

## Correlation Analysis and Variable Relationships (RQ8)

Correlation analysis reveals important relationships between SUoA
selection and various study characteristics, demonstrating that
methodological choices operate relatively independently of technological
advancement and analytical sophistication.

```{r correlation-matrix, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Correlation matrix figure with safe loading
correlation_path <- paste0(fig_path, current_date, "_correlation_matrix.png")
safe_include_graphics(correlation_path, "Correlation matrix figure not available")
```

Figure 10 shows correlations between continuous variables influencing
SUoA selection: log unit size, publication year, total variables, and
variable diversity.

Publication year shows minimal correlation with log unit size (*r* =
`r round(correlation_matrix["Year", "Unit_size_log10"], 3)`), consistent
with our earlier finding of no significant temporal trend (*β* =
`r year_beta`, *p* = `r year_p`), confirming that technological advances
haven't driven systematic changes in scale selection over time. Total
variables shows minimal correlation with log unit size (*r* =
`r round(correlation_matrix["Total_Variables", "Unit_size_log10"], 3)`),
indicating that variable-rich methods are used across all spatial
scales.

Total variables shows weak correlation with publication year (*r* =
`r round(correlation_matrix["Total_Variables", "Year"], 3)`), suggesting
modest increases in analytical complexity over time. Variable diversity
shows weak correlation with total variables (*r* =
`r round(correlation_matrix["Variable_Diversity_Score", "Total_Variables"], 3)`),
indicating that methodological sophistication spans multiple theoretical
domains.

The correlation pattern demonstrates that SUoA selection reflects
methodological adaptation to institutional constraints and theoretical
requirements rather than technological convenience or methodological
limitations.

# Conclusions

This narrative review of `r n_studies` crime location choice studies
provides insights into SUoA selection practices in spatial criminology.
Studies demonstrate explicit reasoning for SUoA selection, with
researchers incorporating extensive variable sets
(`r min_variables`-`r max_variables` variables, mean:
`r mean_variables`) and acknowledging data limitations (mean:
`r mean_limitations`/8 dimensions). Researchers show awareness of
scale-dependent processes, with crime-type specificity in SUoA choices:
micro-environmental crimes employ property-level units, property crimes
use neighborhood-level analysis, and multi-crime studies utilize
administrative units.

Country-level clustering in SUoA preferences (ICC = `r icc`)
demonstrates that national data infrastructure and research traditions
significantly shape methodological possibilities. Contrary to
technological determinism expectations, temporal trends show no
systematic shift toward finer scales (*β* = `r year_beta`, *p* =
`r year_p`), indicating that institutional factors constrain
methodological evolution. The patterns reveal systematic reasoning that
combines theoretical considerations with practical constraints rather
than arbitrary methodological choices.

Several limitations affect our findings. Our focus on published studies
may introduce publication bias toward successful methodological
applications. The narrative review approach lacks the systematic quality
assessment of systematic reviews. Our analysis is limited to
English-language publications and spans 22 years (2003-2025), which may
be insufficient to detect longer-term methodological evolution patterns.
The categorization of SUoA rationales relied on author statements that
may not fully capture complex decision-making processes underlying scale
selection.

Future research should examine how different SUoA affect substantive
findings for identical research questions. For example, analyzing the
same burglary dataset using property-level, street segment, and census
block units to quantify scale effects on coefficient estimates and
policy implications. Systematic comparison of SUoA selection practices
across different institutional contexts could examine how differences in
administrative data systems between UK Lower Super Output Areas and
Dutch postal code areas influence analytical possibilities and research
outcomes. Controlled studies systematically varying SUoA for identical
crime phenomena, such as analyzing street robbery data across multiple
scales (address points, street segments, census blocks, neighborhoods),
could identify optimal scales for different theoretical mechanisms and
practical applications.

The extraordinary variation in SUoA-spanning `r orders_magnitude` orders
of magnitude-reflects both theoretical adaptation and institutional
constraints. This review documents current practices and identifies
opportunities for advancing methodological coherence in spatial
criminology research.
