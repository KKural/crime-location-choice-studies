### Fotheringham & Wong (1991) - "The modifiable areal unit problem in multivariate statistical analysis"

**Full Citation:** Fotheringham, A. S., & Wong, D. W. S. (1991). The modifiable areal unit problem in multivariate statistical analysis. Environment and Planning A, 23(7), 1025-1044. https://doi.org/10.1068/a231025

**Key Content from Abstract:**
> "In this paper the examination of the modifiable areal unit problem is extended into multivariate statistical analysis. In an investigation of the parameter estimates from a multiple linear regression model and a multiple logit regression model, conclusions are drawn about the sensitivity of such estimates to variations in scale and zoning systems. The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units."

**Relevance to Manuscript:** ✅ **APPROPRIATE**
- Directly supports claims about the impact of SUoA on statistical power and interpretation
- Specifically addresses multivariate statistical analysis and its unreliability with aggregated data
- Provides evidence for "unpredictable intensity and effects" of spatial aggregation choices
- Highly cited (1,975 citations) and foundational work in spatial analysis

**Available Supporting Quotes:**
- "essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis"
- "much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis"
- "strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units"

### Openshaw (1984) - "Ecological fallacies and the analysis of areal census data"

**Full Citation:** Openshaw, S. (1984). Ecological fallacies and the analysis of areal census data. Environment and Planning A, 16(1), 17-31. https://doi.org/10.1068/a160017

**Key Content from Abstract:**
> "In many countries census data are only reported for areal units and not at the individual level. This custom raises the spectre of ecological fallacy problems. In this paper, a 10% sample census (from the United Kingdom) and individual census data (from Italy) are used to provide an empirical demonstration of the nature and magnitude of these problems. It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques."

**Relevance to Manuscript:** ✅ **APPROPRIATE**
- Addresses ecological fallacy problems inherent in areal data analysis
- Provides empirical evidence of unpredictable effects
- Supports arguments about the impact of spatial unit choices on analysis validity
- Foundational work in spatial analysis (897 citations)

**Available Supporting Quotes:**
- "ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data"
- "no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques"
- "raises the spectre of ecological fallacy problems"

## Summary for Manuscript Usage

### Appropriate Citation Context
The manuscript uses these citations to support the statement about SUoA impact on statistical power, interpretation, and policy relevance. This usage is **appropriate** because:

1. **Fotheringham & Wong (1991)** specifically demonstrates the "unreliability of multivariate analysis" with areal data
2. **Openshaw (1984)** establishes that ecological fallacy effects are "endemic" to areal data
3. Both papers emphasize the unpredictable nature of these effects
4. Both are foundational, highly-cited works in spatial analysis

### Recommended Citation Format
The current citation format [@fotheringham1991; @openshaw1984] is appropriate for supporting the general claim about SUoA impacts on statistical analysis.

### Additional Context
While I couldn't access specific page numbers from the full texts, both abstracts and the extensive citation patterns confirm these are the correct foundational papers for supporting claims about the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and ecological fallacy issues in spatial analysis.

**Note:** If specific page numbers are required for the final manuscript, the authors should access the full papers through institutional subscriptions to provide exact quotes and page references.
