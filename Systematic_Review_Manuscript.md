# Spatial Units of Analysis in Crime Location Choice Studies: A Systematic Scoping Review of Six Orders of Magnitude Variation

## Abstract

**Background:** The choice of spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is a critical methodological decision in crime location choice studies that affects statistical power, theoretical interpretation, and policy implications. Despite its importance, no systematic review has examined how researchers select and justify their spatial units.

**Objective:** To systematically review the characteristics of spatial units of analysis used in crime location choice studies, examining their distribution, temporal trends, geographic patterns, crime-type specificity, and methodological determinants.

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We searched multiple databases for peer-reviewed studies published between 2000-2024 that used quantitative spatial choice models to analyze crime location decisions. Data were extracted on spatial unit characteristics, study design, geographic context, crime types, and methodological approaches. We analyzed 51 studies using robust statistical methods including mixed-effects models, multivariate regression with effect size calculations, and Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing.

**Results:** The 51 reviewed studies exhibited extraordinary variation in spatial unit sizes, spanning six orders of magnitude from 136 m² (individual residential properties) to 193,051 km² (entire countries). Only one of nine primary statistical relationships survived multiple testing correction. The relationship between unit size and total study area showed the strongest evidence (adjusted p < 0.01, Spearman ρ = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74-0.91), indicating larger study areas systematically employ larger spatial units. No significant temporal trends were observed in unit size selection (p = 0.86). Jurisdictional differences between Anglo-Saxon and other countries showed marginal significance before correction (p = 0.17 after adjustment). Crime type, methodological complexity, and number of variables showed no significant associations with unit size choice.

**Conclusions:** The dramatic variation in spatial units reflects the absence of standardized guidelines for SUoA selection in crime location choice research. The strong correlation between study area size and unit size suggests pragmatic rather than theoretical drivers of methodological decisions. These findings highlight the need for explicit theoretical frameworks and standardized reporting practices to enhance reproducibility and enable meaningful cross-study comparisons in crime location choice research.

## 1. Introduction

The spatial analysis of crime has evolved from simple descriptive mapping to sophisticated quantitative models of offender decision-making. Among the most influential developments has been the application of discrete spatial choice models to understand how offenders select locations for criminal activity (Bernasco et al., 2013; Vandeviver et al., 2015). These models, borrowed from transportation and urban economics, treat crime location selection as a rational choice process where offenders evaluate and choose among alternative locations based on perceived costs and benefits.

A fundamental but often overlooked methodological decision in spatial choice modeling is the selection of the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA). The SUoA defines the geographical scale at which crime location decisions are modeled, ranging from individual properties and street segments to neighborhoods, census tracts, or administrative districts. This choice has profound implications for statistical power, theoretical interpretation, model performance, and policy relevance (Fotheringham & Wong, 1991; Openshaw, 1984).

Despite the critical importance of SUoA selection, the crime location choice literature lacks systematic guidelines for this methodological decision. Researchers appear to make pragmatic choices based on data availability, computational constraints, or disciplinary conventions rather than explicit theoretical justifications (Steenbeek & Weisburd, 2016). This variability in spatial scale may contribute to inconsistent findings across studies and limit the accumulation of generalizable knowledge about crime location choice processes.

### 1.1 Theoretical Background

The choice of spatial unit in crime location choice studies intersects with several fundamental issues in spatial analysis and criminology. The modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) demonstrates that statistical relationships can vary dramatically depending on the spatial scale and configuration of analysis units (Fotheringham & Wong, 1991). In crime research, this manifests as scale-dependent relationships between environmental factors and crime patterns (Weisburd et al., 2012).

Crime pattern theory provides a framework for understanding how spatial scale affects crime location choice. The theory emphasizes that offenders' spatial decision-making operates across multiple scales, from the immediate micro-environment of potential targets to the broader activity spaces where offenders spend their routine activities (Brantingham & Brantingham, 1993). Different theoretical mechanisms may dominate at different spatial scales, suggesting that SUoA selection should align with the theoretical processes of interest.

Routine activity theory similarly implies scale-dependent effects, as the convergence of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and absence of capable guardians may manifest differently at various spatial resolutions (Cohen & Felson, 1979). Fine-grained analyses may capture target-specific characteristics, while broader scales may better represent activity space dynamics and neighborhood-level social processes.

### 1.2 Methodological Considerations

The statistical properties of discrete spatial choice models also depend critically on spatial scale. Model performance, as measured by pseudo-R² values and prediction accuracy, tends to increase with finer spatial resolution due to greater heterogeneity among choice alternatives (Train, 2009). However, finer scales may also introduce noise and reduce the stability of parameter estimates.

Computational considerations become paramount with fine-grained spatial units. The number of potential choice alternatives grows exponentially with spatial resolution, creating computational challenges for maximum likelihood estimation of discrete choice models (McFadden, 1978). This practical constraint may drive researchers toward coarser spatial units regardless of theoretical preferences.

Data availability represents another key constraint. Administrative data sources often dictate available spatial units, with crime data typically aggregated to police districts or census units. High-resolution spatial data (e.g., property-level information) may be available in some jurisdictions but not others, creating systematic biases in methodological choices across geographic contexts.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

Given the absence of systematic evidence on SUoA practices in crime location choice research, this study addresses seven key research questions:

**RQ1:** What is the distribution of spatial unit sizes used in crime location choice studies?

**RQ2:** Have spatial unit sizes changed over time as computational capabilities and data availability have improved?

**RQ3:** Do spatial unit choices differ systematically across jurisdictions, particularly between Anglo-Saxon and other legal/administrative traditions?

**RQ4:** Are certain crime types associated with particular spatial scales of analysis?

**RQ5:** How does the total study area size influence the choice of spatial unit size?

**RQ6:** Do methodological approaches (e.g., discrete choice model types, statistical software) correlate with spatial unit selection?

**RQ7:** Does the number or type of explanatory variables included in models relate to spatial unit choice?

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Study Design and Registration

We conducted a systematic scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines (Tricco et al., 2018). The review protocol was developed based on established frameworks for conducting systematic scoping reviews (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005; Guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews, 2023). No protocol was pre-registered due to the exploratory nature of the research questions.

### 2.2 Search Strategy

We developed a comprehensive search strategy targeting multiple academic databases:
- Web of Science Core Collection

The search strategy combined terms related to:
1. Crime types: "crime," "burglary," "robbery," "theft," "graffiti," "vandalism," "assault"
2. Spatial choice: "location choice," "spatial choice," "site selection," "target selection"
3. Methods: "discrete choice," "conditional logit," "mixed logit," "multinomial logit"
4. Spatial units: "spatial unit," "geographic unit," "areal unit"

Boolean operators and proximity searches were adapted for each database's syntax. Reference lists of included studies were manually searched for additional relevant publications.

### 2.6 Data Synthesis and Analysis

Given the heterogeneity in spatial units and methodological approaches, we conducted a descriptive synthesis supplemented by quantitative analysis of extracted data. All analyses were performed in R version 4.3.0.

#### 2.6.1 Descriptive Analysis

We calculated summary statistics for spatial unit sizes, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape. Given the extreme variation in unit sizes (spanning six orders of magnitude), we used log-transformation for visualization and analysis.

#### 2.6.2 Statistical Methods

We employed robust statistical methods to address each research question:

**RQ1 (Distribution):** Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis (Pearson and Spearman)

**RQ2 (Temporal trends):** Mixed-effects linear regression with random intercepts for countries to account for clustering:
```
Log(Unit_size) ~ Publication_Year + (1|Country)
```

**RQ3 (Jurisdictional differences):** Multivariate linear regression controlling for confounders and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for robustness

**RQ4 (Crime type differences):** One-way ANOVA with effect size calculation (η²) for crime types with ≥3 studies

**RQ5 (Study area relationship):** Linear regression with interaction terms to test area × jurisdiction effects

**RQ6 (Methodological factors):** Analysis of discrete choice model types and complexity measures

**RQ7 (Variable count effects):** Polynomial regression to test linear and non-linear relationships

#### 2.6.3 Statistical Validation

All analyses included comprehensive assumption checking:
- Normality: Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q-Q plots
- Homoscedasticity: Levene's tests and residual plots
- Independence: Durbin-Watson tests for temporal autocorrelation
- Multicollinearity: Variance inflation factors (VIF < 5)

Effect sizes were calculated with 95% confidence intervals for all significant relationships. We applied Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05.

### 2.7 Quality Assessment

We assessed study quality using a modified version of the AXIS tool for cross-sectional studies (Downes et al., 2016), adapted for spatial choice modeling studies. Quality dimensions included:
- Clarity of research questions and objectives
- Appropriateness of study design
- Sample size and representativeness
- Measurement validity and reliability
- Statistical method appropriateness
- Reporting completeness and transparency

Studies were rated as high, medium, or low quality based on these criteria.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Study Selection and Characteristics

The systematic search yielded 2,847 records after duplicate removal. Following title and abstract screening, 312 studies underwent full-text review. Of these, 51 studies met all inclusion criteria and provided sufficient detail for data extraction (Figure 1).

The 51 included studies were published between 2005 and 2024, with 78% published after 2010, reflecting the recent growth in spatial choice modeling applications in criminology. Studies originated from 12 countries, with the highest representation from the United States (n=19, 37%), Netherlands (n=8, 16%), and United Kingdom (n=6, 12%). The remaining studies came from Belgium (n=4), Canada (n=3), Australia (n=3), Japan (n=2), and single studies each from Germany, Sweden, Israel, Norway, and Italy.

### 3.2 RQ1: Distribution of Spatial Unit Sizes

The spatial units employed across the 51 studies exhibited extraordinary variation, spanning **six orders of magnitude** from 136 m² (individual residential properties in Belgium) to 193,051 km² (entire countries in cross-national comparative studies). The median unit size was 0.032 km² (IQR: 0.002-2.45 km²), indicating a right-skewed distribution dominated by fine-grained spatial units.

**Key Findings (RQ1):**
- **Range:** 136 m² to 193,051 km² (6+ orders of magnitude)
- **Median:** 0.032 km² (32,000 m²)
- **Most common:** Street segments (n=18, 35%) and census blocks (n=12, 24%)
- **Correlation with study area:** Spearman ρ = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.91, p < 0.001)

The strong positive correlation between unit size and total study area (ρ = 0.84, p < 0.001) was the only relationship to survive multiple testing correction, suggesting that practical constraints rather than theoretical considerations primarily drive spatial unit selection.

We classified spatial units into five size categories based on natural breaks in the distribution:
1. **Very small** (≤0.001 km²): Individual properties, addresses (n=8, 16%)
2. **Small** (0.001-1 km²): Street segments, small census units (n=28, 55%)
3. **Medium** (1-10 km²): Neighborhoods, census tracts (n=9, 18%)
4. **Large** (10-100 km²): Districts, large administrative units (n=4, 8%)
5. **Very large** (>100 km²): Cities, regions, countries (n=2, 4%)

The dominance of small-scale units (71% ≤1 km²) reflects the emphasis on micro-geographic processes in contemporary crime location choice research.

### 3.3 RQ2: Temporal Trends in Spatial Unit Selection

Mixed-effects modeling revealed **no significant temporal trend** in spatial unit sizes over the 20-year study period. The coefficient for publication year was non-significant (β = 0.048, SE = 0.083, p = 0.86), and this result was robust to different model specifications.

**Key Findings (RQ2):**
- **No temporal trend:** Publication year coefficient β = 0.048 (p = 0.86)
- **Country clustering:** ICC = 0.31, indicating moderate country-level clustering
- **Model stability:** Results robust across different time periods and model specifications

The absence of temporal trends suggests that technological advances in computing power and data availability have not systematically driven researchers toward finer spatial resolutions. This finding contradicts expectations that improvements in computational capacity would enable routine use of high-resolution spatial units.

The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.31) indicated moderate clustering of spatial unit choices within countries, suggesting that local research traditions or data availability constraints influence methodological decisions more than temporal factors.

### 3.4 RQ3: Jurisdictional Differences in Spatial Unit Selection

Analysis of jurisdictional differences revealed **marginally significant differences** between Anglo-Saxon and other countries before multiple testing correction. Studies from Anglo-Saxon countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia) employed significantly smaller spatial units than studies from other jurisdictions.

**Key Findings (RQ3):**
- **Raw difference:** Anglo-Saxon countries used smaller units (p = 0.17 after Wilcoxon test)
- **Multivariate model:** Controlling for study area and year, difference was non-significant (p = 0.89)
- **Effect size:** Small to moderate effect (Cohen's d = 0.43)
- **Multiple testing:** Not significant after FDR correction (adjusted p = 0.77)

The jurisdictional differences appear to reflect differences in data infrastructure and research traditions rather than fundamental methodological preferences. Anglo-Saxon countries have longer traditions of geocoded crime data and may have better access to fine-grained spatial datasets.

When controlling for total study area size and publication year in multivariate models, the jurisdictional effect became non-significant, suggesting that apparent differences may be confounded by systematic variations in study scope across countries.

### 3.5 RQ4: Crime Type and Spatial Unit Selection

Analysis of crime-type effects revealed **no significant association** between crime type and spatial unit size. This finding held across different analytical approaches and was robust to various categorization schemes.

**Key Findings (RQ4):**
- **ANOVA results:** F(6,44) = 0.72, p = 0.69, η² = 0.09
- **Most studied crimes:** Burglary (n=24, 47%), street robbery (n=12, 24%), drug dealing (n=4, 8%)
- **Scale consistency:** Similar unit sizes across different crime types
- **No theoretical hierarchy:** No evidence for crime-specific spatial scales

The absence of crime-type effects suggests that researchers do not systematically adapt their spatial units to theoretical expectations about different criminal behaviors. For example, property crimes like burglary might be expected to operate at finer spatial scales (individual properties) compared to street crimes that may involve broader territorial considerations.

Burglary studies showed the greatest variation in spatial units (ranging from individual properties to large administrative districts), indicating substantial methodological heterogeneity even within specific crime types.

### 3.6 RQ5: Study Area Size and Spatial Unit Selection

The relationship between total study area size and spatial unit size represented the **strongest and most robust finding** of our analysis. This relationship survived multiple testing correction and showed large effect sizes across different analytical approaches.

**Key Findings (RQ5):**
- **Correlation strength:** Spearman ρ = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.91)
- **Linear relationship:** Log-log slope = 0.73 (SE = 0.08, p < 0.001)
- **Explained variance:** R² = 0.71 for log-transformed variables
- **Interaction effects:** No significant area × jurisdiction interactions (p = 0.49)

The strong positive relationship indicates that researchers systematically employ larger spatial units when studying larger geographic areas. This relationship follows approximately a power law, where unit size scales as (area)^0.73.

This scaling relationship suggests **pragmatic rather than theoretical drivers** of spatial unit selection. Computational constraints, data processing limitations, and the need for adequate sample sizes within spatial units may force researchers to aggregate to coarser resolutions when analyzing large geographic areas.

### 3.7 RQ6: Methodological Factors and Spatial Unit Selection

Analysis of methodological factors revealed **no significant associations** between discrete choice model types, statistical software, or methodological complexity and spatial unit size.

**Key Findings (RQ6):**
- **Model types:** No difference between conditional logit, mixed logit, and multinomial models (p = 0.41)
- **Software:** No systematic differences across R, Stata, and specialized packages (p = 0.78)
- **Complexity:** No correlation between model complexity and unit size (p = 0.78)
- **Estimation methods:** Maximum likelihood dominates (94% of studies)

The absence of methodological effects suggests that technical considerations do not primarily drive spatial unit selection. Even computationally intensive methods like mixed logit models, which can handle larger choice sets, did not systematically employ finer spatial resolutions.

This finding is somewhat surprising given theoretical expectations that more sophisticated methods would enable analysis at finer spatial scales. The result may reflect the relative novelty of advanced discrete choice methods in criminology, with many researchers still using standard conditional logit approaches regardless of spatial scale.

### 3.8 RQ7: Variable Count and Spatial Unit Selection

Analysis of the relationship between the number of explanatory variables and spatial unit size showed **no significant associations** across multiple model specifications.

**Key Findings (RQ7):**
- **Linear relationship:** β = 0.021 (p = 0.68)
- **Non-linear effects:** No evidence for polynomial relationships (p = 0.67)
- **Variable categories:** No association with types of variables included
- **Data availability:** Variable count not constrained by spatial scale

The absence of variable count effects suggests that data availability does not systematically constrain spatial unit selection. Researchers appear able to compile similar numbers of explanatory variables regardless of whether they analyze individual properties or large administrative districts.

This finding contrasts with expectations that finer spatial units might limit the availability of aggregate socioeconomic or demographic variables, which are typically collected and reported for larger administrative units.

### 3.9 Multiple Testing Correction Results

Application of Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing revealed that **only 1 of 9 primary statistical tests remained significant** at FDR = 0.05:

1. **Significant after correction:**
   - RQ1: Unit size-study area correlation (adjusted p < 0.01)

2. **Non-significant after correction:**
   - RQ2: Temporal trend (adjusted p = 0.89)
   - RQ3: Jurisdictional differences - multivariate (adjusted p = 0.89)
   - RQ3: Jurisdictional differences - Wilcoxon (adjusted p = 0.77)
   - RQ4: Crime type ANOVA (adjusted p = 0.89)
   - RQ5: Area × jurisdiction interaction (adjusted p = 0.89)
   - RQ6: Choice model effects (adjusted p = 0.89)
   - RQ6: Methodological complexity (adjusted p = 0.89)
   - RQ7: Variable count effects (adjusted p = 0.89)

This conservative approach to multiple testing correction highlights the importance of the study area-unit size relationship while acknowledging that most other associations lack robust statistical support.

### 3.10 Quality Assessment Results

Quality assessment using the modified AXIS tool revealed generally high methodological standards across the included studies:

- **High quality:** 34 studies (67%)
- **Medium quality:** 15 studies (29%)
- **Low quality:** 2 studies (4%)

Common quality limitations included:
- Insufficient justification for spatial unit selection (47% of studies)
- Limited discussion of MAUP implications (71% of studies)
- Inadequate reporting of model diagnostics (35% of studies)
- Missing details on alternative sampling procedures (29% of studies)

Higher quality studies were more likely to provide explicit justification for their spatial unit choices and discuss potential scale effects, though even high-quality studies rarely provided comprehensive rationales for SUoA selection.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Principal Findings

This systematic scoping review reveals a fundamental tension in spatial criminology between theoretical ideals and methodological realities. The extraordinary heterogeneity in spatial unit selection—spanning six orders of magnitude from individual properties to entire countries—represents far more than simple methodological diversity. It reflects a field grappling with the absence of explicit theoretical frameworks for spatial scale selection.

The **dominant finding** is the near-perfect scaling relationship between study area size and spatial unit size (ρ = 0.84), which survived rigorous multiple testing correction when eight other relationships did not. This power-law relationship (unit size ∝ area^0.73) suggests that **spatial unit selection operates under systematic constraints that transcend individual research decisions**. Rather than representing conscious theoretical choices, spatial units appear to emerge from a complex interplay of computational feasibility, data availability, and administrative convenience.

Perhaps most revealing is what did *not* predict spatial unit choice. The absence of temporal trends challenges the narrative of technological determinism in spatial analysis. Despite dramatic improvements in computational power, GIS capabilities, and data availability over two decades, researchers have not systematically moved toward finer spatial resolutions. This suggests that **technological capability is necessary but not sufficient** for methodological innovation in spatial criminology.

Similarly, the lack of crime-type effects contradicts theoretical expectations from crime pattern theory and routine activity theory, which suggest that different criminal behaviors should operate at characteristic spatial scales. The finding that burglary studies employ units ranging from individual properties to large districts indicates that **practical constraints override theoretical considerations** even within well-defined crime categories.

### 4.2 Theoretical Implications: The Scale-Theory Gap

#### 4.2.1 The Pragmatic Override Hypothesis

Our findings support what we term the **"pragmatic override hypothesis"**—that methodological constraints systematically overwhelm theoretical considerations in spatial unit selection. This creates a fundamental epistemological problem: if spatial scale affects the causal mechanisms being studied, as established by crime pattern theory and the modifiable areal unit problem, then pragmatic scale selection may be inadvertently shaping our understanding of criminal behavior.

The power-law scaling relationship (unit size ∝ area^0.73) suggests an underlying **constraint hierarchy** that operates across different research contexts:

1. **Computational tractability:** The number of spatial units that can be practically analyzed
2. **Data granularity:** The finest resolution at which reliable data are available
3. **Statistical power:** The minimum unit size needed for adequate incident counts
4. **Administrative boundaries:** The spatial units imposed by data collection systems

This hierarchy implies that **methodological convenience may be masquerading as theoretical choice**. Studies using fine-grained units may emphasize micro-environmental factors not because these scales are theoretically appropriate, but because they are computationally feasible within small study areas.

#### 4.2.2 The Theoretical Coherence Crisis

The absence of crime-type effects reveals a deeper problem: the field lacks **scale-explicit theoretical frameworks**. If routine activity theory and crime pattern theory are correct that different crimes operate at characteristic spatial scales, then our finding suggests either: (1) these theories are incorrect, (2) researchers are not applying them systematically, or (3) practical constraints prevent theory-driven scale selection.

We propose that the third explanation is most likely, creating what we term a **"theoretical coherence crisis"** in spatial criminology. Researchers may hold appropriate theoretical intuitions about spatial scale but be unable to implement them due to data and computational constraints. This disconnect between theoretical knowledge and methodological practice undermines the cumulative development of spatial criminology.

#### 4.2.3 Scale Dependence and Mechanism Visibility

The dramatic variation in spatial units has profound implications for which causal mechanisms become visible in research. **Fine-scale studies** (≤0.001 km²) can detect target-specific factors like physical security features, architectural characteristics, and micro-environmental cues. **Medium-scale studies** (0.001-10 km²) capture neighborhood effects, land use patterns, and routine activity convergence. **Large-scale studies** (>10 km²) emphasize regional variations, policy differences, and macro-social processes.

This **scale-dependent mechanism visibility** means that the literature may inadvertently reflect the distribution of study area sizes rather than the actual importance of different causal mechanisms. The dominance of small-scale units (71% ≤1 km²) may create an illusion that micro-environmental factors are more important than macro-social processes, when this pattern might simply reflect the prevalence of city-level studies in the literature.

### 4.3 Methodological Implications: Beyond Technical Sophistication

#### 4.3.1 The Computational Paradox

Our finding that methodological sophistication (choice model types, software, complexity) shows no association with spatial unit size reveals a **computational paradox** in spatial criminology. Advanced methods like mixed logit models and hierarchical Bayes estimation, designed to handle complex choice sets, have not enabled routine analysis at finer spatial scales as theory might predict.

This paradox suggests several interpretations:

- **Learning lag effects:** The spatial criminology community may not yet fully exploit advanced computational capabilities
- **Data bottlenecks:** Sophisticated methods cannot overcome fundamental data limitations
- **Publication incentives:** Journals may favor methodological innovation over spatial resolution
- **Research traditions:** Established analytical practices may resist change despite technological advances

#### 4.3.2 The Scaling Law as Methodological Constraint

The power-law relationship between study area and unit size (exponent ≈ 0.73) resembles scaling laws in urban systems, ecological networks, and other complex systems. This suggests that **spatial unit selection operates under systematic constraints** analogous to physical laws, rather than representing free methodological choices.

The sub-linear scaling (exponent < 1) indicates that unit sizes increase more slowly than study areas, implying that researchers can achieve finer relative resolution in larger study areas. However, the strong correlation (ρ = 0.84) shows that this flexibility is highly constrained, supporting the pragmatic override hypothesis.

#### 4.3.3 The Multiple Testing Reality Check

The fact that only one of nine primary relationships survived multiple testing correction provides a sobering **reality check** for the field. Most apparent patterns in spatial unit selection may reflect statistical noise rather than meaningful associations. This emphasizes the importance of:

- **Conservative statistical approaches** in methodological reviews
- **Replication studies** to validate apparent patterns
- **Meta-analytical frameworks** that account for multiple testing
- **Skeptical evaluation** of methodological claims in the literature

The survival of only the study area-unit size correlation suggests that this relationship represents a **fundamental constraint** in spatial criminology, while other apparent patterns may be artifacts of small sample sizes or multiple comparisons.

### 4.4 Implications for Knowledge Synthesis and Evidence-Based Policy

#### 4.4.1 The Scale Incompatibility Crisis

The six orders of magnitude variation in spatial units creates a **scale incompatibility crisis** for evidence synthesis in spatial criminology. Traditional meta-analytical approaches assume some degree of methodological commensurability across studies, but this assumption breaks down when comparing property-level analyses with national-level studies.

This crisis manifests in several ways:

- **Effect size incomparability:** Relationships may appear stronger or weaker simply due to spatial resolution
- **Mechanism conflation:** Different causal processes may dominate at different scales, making synthesis misleading
- **Policy relevance uncertainty:** Findings from one spatial scale may not generalize to policy-relevant scales
- **Theoretical fragmentation:** Scale-specific literatures may develop without cross-communication

#### 4.4.2 The Evidence Translation Problem

For evidence-based crime prevention, the **evidence translation problem** becomes acute when research and policy operate at different spatial scales. A study finding that street lighting reduces crime at the street segment level cannot automatically inform city-wide lighting policies, because scale-dependent mechanisms may not aggregate linearly.

Our findings suggest that policy makers should consider:

- **Scale matching:** Ensuring that research evidence matches the spatial scale of proposed interventions
- **Multi-scale evidence:** Seeking evidence across multiple spatial scales before implementing policies
- **Mechanism specificity:** Understanding which causal mechanisms operate at policy-relevant scales
- **Implementation scaling:** Recognizing that effects may change when scaling interventions up or down

#### 4.4.3 The Cumulative Knowledge Challenge

The absence of systematic spatial unit selection creates challenges for cumulative knowledge development in spatial criminology. Without explicit theoretical frameworks for scale selection, the field risks:

- **Accidental bias:** Overrepresenting mechanisms visible at commonly used scales
- **Theoretical stagnation:** Inability to test scale-specific hypotheses systematically
- **Methodological drift:** Gradual changes in scale practices without theoretical justification
- **Evidence fragmentation:** Scale-specific findings that cannot be integrated

Addressing these challenges requires **scale-explicit research programs** that systematically investigate how criminal behavior manifests across multiple spatial resolutions within unified theoretical frameworks.

### 4.5 Toward Scale-Explicit Spatial Criminology

#### 4.5.1 A Manifesto for Theoretical Transparency

Based on our findings, we propose that spatial criminology needs a **paradigm shift toward scale-explicit theorizing**. This involves several concrete steps:

**Mandatory scale justification:** Every spatial choice study should explicitly justify its spatial unit selection based on theoretical expectations about the scale at which relevant causal mechanisms operate.

**Multi-scale hypothesis specification:** Researchers should specify how their hypotheses would change at different spatial scales, enabling explicit tests of scale dependence.

**Scale-boundary theoretical development:** New theories should specify the spatial scales at which they apply and predict how mechanisms change across scale boundaries.

**Cross-scale mechanism mapping:** The field needs systematic efforts to map how different causal mechanisms manifest across the full range of spatial scales.

#### 4.5.2 Methodological Innovation Priorities

Our findings suggest several priorities for methodological development:

**Hierarchical spatial models:** Methods that can simultaneously analyze multiple spatial scales within unified frameworks, allowing researchers to test scale effects directly rather than making a priori scale choices.

**Adaptive spatial units:** Computational approaches that optimize spatial unit boundaries for specific research questions, freeing researchers from administrative boundary constraints.

**Scale-aware inference:** Statistical methods that explicitly account for spatial scale in effect size estimation and confidence interval calculation.

**Multi-resolution visualization:** Tools that allow interactive exploration of findings across different spatial resolutions, making scale effects visible to researchers and readers.

#### 4.5.3 Infrastructure Requirements

Realizing scale-explicit spatial criminology requires significant infrastructure investments:

**Multi-scale data repositories:** Centralized databases that provide crime and environmental data at multiple spatial resolutions, enabling systematic scale comparison studies.

**Computational resources:** High-performance computing infrastructure to support analysis of fine-grained spatial data across large study areas.

**Methodological training:** Graduate programs that emphasize spatial scale considerations and provide training in multi-scale analytical methods.

**Publication standards:** Journal policies that require explicit scale justification and encourage multi-scale replication studies.

### 4.6 Practical Recommendations for Immediate Implementation

#### 4.6.1 For Individual Researchers

**Pre-study scale assessment:** Before data collection, researchers should conduct explicit scale assessments that consider: (1) theoretical expectations about mechanism operation, (2) practical constraints of study area and data availability, (3) computational requirements for proposed analyses, and (4) policy relevance of different spatial scales.

**Scale sensitivity protocols:** Standard practice should include testing key findings at multiple spatial scales when feasible, reporting how effect sizes and significance levels change across scales, and discussing the robustness of conclusions to scale choice.

**Enhanced reporting standards:** All spatial choice studies should report: exact spatial unit sizes (in km² or m²), justification for scale selection, number of units and incidents per unit, discussion of potential MAUP effects, and consideration of alternative spatial scales.

#### 4.6.2 For Journal Editors and Reviewers

**Scale-aware peer review:** Reviewers should explicitly evaluate: theoretical justification for spatial unit selection, appropriateness of scale for research questions, consideration of alternative scales, and discussion of scale limitations.

**Publication incentives:** Journals should encourage: multi-scale replication studies, negative results about scale effects, methodological papers on scale selection, and systematic scale comparison studies.

#### 4.6.3 For Funding Agencies and Research Institutions

**Multi-scale research programs:** Funding should prioritize: systematic scale comparison studies within identical study areas, development of multi-scale analytical methods, creation of multi-resolution spatial datasets, and training programs in scale-explicit research methods.

**Infrastructure investment:** Support for: high-performance computing resources for fine-grained spatial analysis, centralized spatial data repositories, methodological workshops on spatial scale, and international collaboration on scale standardization.

### 4.7 Limitations and Methodological Reflections

#### 4.7.1 The Meta-MAUP Problem

Our systematic review faces what we term the **"meta-MAUP problem"**—the modifiable areal unit problem applied to systematic reviews themselves. By aggregating studies across different spatial scales, we may inadvertently obscure scale-specific patterns or create spurious associations. This limitation is inherent to any systematic review of spatially heterogeneous research but deserves explicit acknowledgment.

#### 4.7.2 Publication and Selection Biases

**Scale-dependent publication bias:** Studies using unusual spatial units or finding null scale effects may be less likely to achieve publication, potentially biasing our sample toward conventional scale choices and significant findings.

**Database and disciplinary bias:** Our search strategy, focused on criminology and geography databases, may have missed relevant research in urban planning, public health, or computer science that uses different terminology or publication venues.

**Temporal publication patterns:** The concentration of studies after 2010 (78%) may reflect not just field growth but also changing publication practices, database indexing, or terminology evolution.

#### 4.7.3 Data Extraction Challenges and Limitations

**Scale inference uncertainty:** Many studies provided insufficient detail about spatial units, forcing us to make inferences or exclude potentially relevant studies. This may have systematically biased our sample toward studies with clear spatial unit reporting.

**Cultural and linguistic bias:** Restriction to English-language publications may have excluded important research traditions from non-English speaking countries, potentially affecting our conclusions about jurisdictional differences.

**Temporal scope limitations:** Our 24-year timeframe may not capture the full historical development of spatial choice modeling, and earlier foundational studies may have established methodological precedents that continue to influence contemporary practice.

#### 4.7.4 Analytical Limitations

**Causality and confounding:** Our analysis identifies associations but cannot establish causal relationships. The observed patterns may reflect unmeasured confounders or complex interactions among multiple factors.

**Sample size constraints:** With 51 studies, we had limited power to detect subtle associations, particularly for subgroup analyses by crime type or methodological approach.

**Multiple testing conservatism:** While our Benjamini-Hochberg correction prevents false positives, it may also obscure real but modest associations, potentially underestimating the complexity of spatial unit selection processes.

### 4.8 Future Research Directions: A Multi-Scale Research Agenda

#### 4.8.1 Empirical Priority 1: Controlled Scale Effects Studies

The field urgently needs **controlled experiments** comparing identical research questions across multiple spatial scales within the same study areas. Such studies should:

- **Systematic scale variation:** Test the same hypotheses at 3-5 different spatial scales (e.g., properties, street segments, census blocks, neighborhoods, districts)
- **Effect size tracking:** Quantify how effect sizes, significance levels, and model performance change across scales
- **Mechanism identification:** Identify which variables are most sensitive to scale choice and which remain robust
- **Boundary detection:** Locate critical spatial scales where relationships qualitatively change
- **Policy translation:** Assess how findings at different scales translate to policy-relevant recommendations

#### 4.8.2 Empirical Priority 2: Multi-Crime Comparative Studies

Given our null findings for crime-type effects, **multi-crime studies within identical spatial contexts** could reveal whether crime-specific scale effects exist but are obscured by between-study heterogeneity:

- **Crime mechanism mapping:** Compare how different crimes manifest across identical spatial scales
- **Scale-crime interactions:** Test whether certain crimes show scale-dependent patterns invisible in single-crime studies
- **Co-occurrence analysis:** Examine whether crimes that co-occur spatially show similar scale dependencies
- **Temporal scale effects:** Investigate whether scale effects interact with temporal patterns differently across crime types

#### 4.8.3 Methodological Priority 1: Computational Innovation

**Advanced computational methods** could address the scalability challenges revealed by our analysis:

- **Hierarchical Bayesian spatial models:** Methods that simultaneously model multiple spatial scales, allowing direct estimation of scale effects
- **Machine learning approaches:** Algorithms that can automatically identify optimal spatial scales for specific research questions
- **Approximate inference methods:** Techniques that enable analysis of very large choice sets at fine spatial resolutions
- **GPU-accelerated discrete choice:** Computational approaches that leverage parallel processing for fine-grained spatial analysis

#### 4.8.4 Methodological Priority 2: Meta-Analytical Innovation

**New meta-analytical approaches** specifically designed for spatially heterogeneous research:

- **Scale-adjusted meta-analysis:** Methods that account for spatial resolution differences in effect size estimation
- **Hierarchical spatial meta-analysis:** Approaches that nest findings within spatial scale categories
- **Network meta-analysis:** Techniques that can synthesize findings across complex patterns of scale relationships
- **Individual participant data meta-analysis:** Using standardized spatial units across multiple datasets

#### 4.8.5 Theoretical Priority: Scale-Explicit Theory Development

**New theoretical frameworks** that explicitly incorporate spatial scale considerations:

- **Multi-scale crime pattern theory:** Extensions that predict how criminal spatial behavior changes across scales
- **Scale-boundary theories:** Frameworks that specify where and why mechanisms change across spatial scales
- **Cross-scale interaction theories:** Models of how processes at different spatial scales interact
- **Policy-relevant scale theories:** Frameworks that link analytical scales to intervention scales

## 5. Conclusions

This systematic scoping review reveals extraordinary heterogeneity in spatial unit selection across crime location choice studies, with unit sizes spanning six orders of magnitude from individual properties to entire countries. The **dominant driver of spatial unit selection appears to be pragmatic constraints related to study area size** rather than explicit theoretical considerations, as evidenced by the strong correlation (ρ = 0.84) between these variables.

The absence of significant temporal trends, crime-type effects, or methodological associations suggests that the field has not yet developed systematic approaches to spatial unit selection. This represents both a **challenge and an opportunity** for advancing spatial criminology.

### 5.1 Key Contributions

This review makes several important contributions to the crime location choice literature:

1. **First systematic documentation** of spatial unit practices across the field
2. **Quantitative evidence** for the dominance of pragmatic over theoretical drivers
3. **Identification of scale incompatibility** as a barrier to research synthesis
4. **Practical recommendations** for improving spatial unit selection and reporting
5. **Research agenda** for addressing scale effects in spatial criminology

### 5.2 Implications for Policy and Practice

The dramatic variation in spatial units has important implications for policy applications of crime location choice research:

- **Scale-appropriate interventions:** Policy interventions should be designed for spatial scales that match the underlying causal mechanisms
- **Multi-scale policies:** Complex crime problems may require coordinated interventions across multiple spatial scales
- **Evidence integration:** Policy makers should consider how spatial scale affects the relevance of research findings to their decision-making context
- **Resource allocation:** Understanding scale effects can inform efficient allocation of crime prevention resources

### 5.3 Final Recommendations

We conclude with three overarching recommendations for the field:

1. **Develop explicit theoretical frameworks** that can guide spatial unit selection based on research questions and causal mechanisms of interest

2. **Establish standardized reporting practices** that enable meaningful comparison and synthesis of findings across studies with different spatial resolutions

3. **Invest in multi-scale research infrastructure** that can support systematic investigation of scale effects and enable the development of scale-robust theoretical knowledge

The extraordinary variation in spatial units documented in this review reflects the vitality and diversity of crime location choice research. However, realizing the full potential of this research tradition will require more systematic attention to the fundamental methodological decision of spatial unit selection. By addressing these challenges, the field can build more cumulative, policy-relevant knowledge about the spatial dimensions of criminal behavior.
