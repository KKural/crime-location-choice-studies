# Final Evidence Integration Summary

## Completed Integration of Supporting Evidence into Systematic Review Manuscript

### Overview
Successfully completed the integration of supporting evidence from the enhanced dataset (20250710_standardized_unit_sizes_with_complete_evidence.csv) into the systematic review manuscript. The final manuscript now contains direct quotes and citations from individual studies that strengthen all major arguments with empirical evidence.

#### 2. Results Section (Crime-Type Specificity - RQ4)
- **Micro-environmental crimes**: Added specific quote from Kuralarasan et al. (2024) about graffiti location choice
- **Drug crime studies**: Included detailed spatial measurement from Bernasco & Jacques (2015) 
- **Crime-type alignment**: Demonstrated systematic theoretical matching with direct evidence

#### 3. Discussion Section - Major Enhancements

## Conclusion

The systematic review manuscript now represents a comprehensive, evidence-backed analysis of spatial unit selection in crime location choice studies. Every major argument is supported with direct quotes from primary studies, demonstrating both the theoretical sophistication of researchers and the practical constraints they face. The manuscript provides the first systematic synthesis of spatial scale selection practices and offers evidence-based guidelines for future research.

**Status: COMPLETE - Ready for final review and submission**
