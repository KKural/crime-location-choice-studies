- The choice set was constructed from 23,984 postal code areas, which served as the alternatives.
- A random sample of 1,499 alternatives was selected from the full choice set to overcome computational burdens.
- The sampling approach was random sampling, as opposed to importance sampling, which was considered but not used due to its limitations in model estimation.
- The sample restrictions included the use of cleared cases only, which might introduce bias, but it was argued that there was sufficient randomness in the clearance process to view the sample as representative."

- The total number of spatial units is given as 4,895 centroids (Number of Units: 4,895).
- The paper does not provide specific information on the population per unit (Population per Unit: Not mentioned).
- The rationale for choosing this spatial scale is related to the need to capture the variance of spatial features and the resolution being fine enough for the data used (Quoted Rationale: ""The resolution of the grid used must be fine enough to capture the variance of spatial features"").
- The rationale category is related to practical constraints and scale optimization, as it depends on the nature of the features used (Rationale Category: Practical constraint / Scale optimization).
- The justification summary is that the grid size was chosen to be fine enough to capture the variance of spatial features, which is a practical consideration for the analysis (Justification Summary: Practical consideration for capturing spatial feature variance).","  - ""The north-south inter-centroid spacing is 170 m, the east-west inter-centroid spacing is 191 m.""

- The specific city studied is Richmond, Virginia.
- The study area size is not explicitly mentioned in terms of total area in km², but the grid dimensions and inter-centroid spacing provide a basis for calculating the area. However, without explicit conversion to km², we cannot provide a precise area size.
- The study area description is the City of Richmond, with a grid system used to discretize the geographic space.
- The primary crime type analyzed is breaking and entering.
- There is no mention of multiple crime types being analyzed; only breaking and entering is specified.","  - ""The complete dataset consists of all reported breaking and entering crime in the City of Richmond, VA for calendar year 1997.""
  - ""To make the assumption of consistent preferences reasonable, only residential breaking and entering crimes occurring in the third quarter of the year were used.""
  - ""This subset contained 637 distinct spatial selections.""
  - ""It was randomly partitioned into test and training subsets in a 1:2 ratio, producing a training set of 425 crime events and a test set of 212.""
  - ""The choice set was defined using the following steps. The smallest rectangle that would wholly circumscribe the boundaries of the City of Richmond was the extents of a grid with 100 rows and 100 columns.""

  - ""Using the 425 site training set, separability scores, f r , were calculated for each of the candidate predictors.""
  - ""Although the selection vector, s, contains 425 elements, because many incidents were closest to the same choice set element, |S| = 319.""",,"- The sampling approach involved using all reported breaking and entering crimes in Richmond, VA, for the year 1997, but only those occurring in the third quarter were used to ensure consistent preferences.
- The total number of crime events analyzed was 637, which were then divided into training and test sets.
- The sample size for the training set was 425 crime events, and for the test set, it was 212 events.
- The choice set was constructed by creating a grid over the city of Richmond, with each grid cell centroid serving as an alternative.
- The number of alternatives in the choice set was 4,895, after removing grid cells outside city limits.
- The alternative selection involved mapping each crime event to the nearest grid cell centroid.
- There is no mention of the number of unique offenders in the study.
- The sample restrictions included only using residential breaking and entering crimes from the third quarter of 1997."

- The data sources include geocoded data from The Hague Police Force, Google Maps, Google Street View, and a community survey conducted by Bruinsma et al. in 2013.

- The study is conducted at the property level, with a focus on the physical attributes of residential homes and their immediate surroundings.
- The spatial units are not explicitly defined in terms of size or type (e.g., census tracts, block groups), but rather as individual properties within neighborhoods.
- The study uses neighborhoods as a broader context to control for contextual characteristics, but the primary focus is on individual properties.
- The justification for using individual properties as spatial units is implicit in the methodology, which aims to isolate property-level effects from neighborhood-level effects.
