Category: Data quality
Summary: The dataset only includes burglaries with identified offenders, which may not represent all burglary incidents.

[Quote 2]: ""The exclusion of suburbs outside of the Perth metropolitan area has influenced the outcome of this analysis."" (Page X)  
Category: Spatial limitations
Summary: The analysis is limited to suburbs within Perth, potentially affecting generalizability.

**Overall Limitation Summary:** The study's findings are constrained by the limited dataset of identified offenders and the geographic focus on Perth suburbs, which may not fully capture broader patterns of burglary behavior.","  - ""The residential burglary data analysed here were provided by the Western Australian Police.""
  - ""The final dataset contained 1,761 singleoffender (actual or attempted) residential burglaries committed between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002 , where the offender resided in the city of Perth.""
  - ""A total of 291 residential suburbs were selected as members of the possible choice set for the residential burglaries examined here.""
  - ""the term suburb as used in Western Australia has a different meaning to other parts of the world (particularly the United States and Canada), and is more akin to a neighbourhood in these areas.""
  - ""The overall geographic placement of these suburbs in relation to the Swan River, selected major roads, and the location of the railway line are displayed in Figure 1""
  - ""The essential elements involved with the application of discrete spatial choice are: (a) defining the boundaries of the choice set, (b) capturing the unique attributes of the decision-makers and (c) modelling the interaction between the individual chooser's characteristics and choice for the whole population""
  - ""The city of Perth is located in the south-west of Western Australia at the coast of the Indian Ocean.""
  - ""The estimated residential population of Perth in 2001 was 1,381,298 people.""
  - ""Perth is the largest city in Western Australia, with suburbs that sprawl along the coast for approximately 100 km and extend inland from the coast by up to 40 km.""
  - ""statistics for this set of suburbs show that they have an average size of 6.76 km 2 with a mean population of 4,669 residents and 1,791 dwellings (ABS, 2003)""",,"- The study uses data provided by the Western Australian Police, which suggests that the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) was chosen based on data availability.
- The study focuses on residential burglaries in Perth, Western Australia, and uses suburbs as the spatial unit, which are akin to neighborhoods in other parts of the world.
- The choice of suburbs as the SUoA is likely due to the availability of data at this level and the need to capture neighborhood-level characteristics.
- The study area includes 291 suburbs, with an average size of 6.76 km² and a mean population of 4,669 residents, indicating a focus on neighborhood-level analysis.
- The rationale for using suburbs is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is due to data availability and the need to analyze neighborhood-level factors influencing burglary."

  - ""The key variables related to the Hukou status and the residential addresses of offenders are only available for arrested offenders, and these variables are essential for testing the hypotheses of this study.""
  - ""The sheer size of the dataset, with 3860 burglaries committed in one of 2643 communities (resulting in a matrix over 10 million rows), prohibited the estimation of the more flexible mixed logit model that was recently used in crime location choice research""

  - ""Third, social disorganization theory (Sampson & Byron Groves, 1989) predicts that communities of high concentrated disadvantage would be attractive for burglars.""
  - ""Fourth, due to the difficulty of data acquisition, the variables such as income level that directly measure the level of wealth of the population are not included in the study, and they are substituted by the proportion of houses built after 2000 and the rent prices.""",,"- The study uses data from 3860 residential burglaries in ZG city, China, which is a significant sample size for analyzing crime patterns.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is the community level, with 2643 communities in ZG city, each with a relatively homogeneous population and an average size of 2.74 km².
- The study relies on data from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which provides crime data for the period January 2012 to June 2016.
- The analysis is limited to arrested offenders due to the availability of key variables related to Hukou status and residential addresses.
- The study uses a conditional logit model, which is a common method for analyzing discrete choice data in crime location studies.
- The study acknowledges several limitations, including the use of a discrete spatial choice framework that only includes cleared burglaries, the temporal mismatch between census data and crime data, and the lack of direct measures of wealth such as income level."

  - ""The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime.""
  - ""Therefore, our first hypothesis is as follows: Hypothesis 1: Offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area where they have offended before than in an area where they have not offended before.""
  - ""Therefore, our second hypothesis is as follows:

Hypothesis 2: The closer an area is to a prior target area, the more likely the offender is to target that area.""
  - ""Therefore, our third hypothesis is as follows:

Hypothesis 3: The more recently an offender has targeted an area, the more likely the offender is to offend in that same area.""
  - ""Therefore, our fourth hypothesis is as follows:

Hypothesis 4: The more crimes an offender has committed in an area, the more likely the offender is to offend in that same area.""
  - ""The offender's residential area has been found to influence crime location choice (e.g., Baudains, Braithwaite, and Johnson, 2013;Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005; Johnson and Summers, 2014; Townsley et al., 2014), and so do former areas of residence (Bernasco, 2010b)""
  - ""Specific target area characteristics were included as control variables in our study because they are described as indicators of crime attractors and crime generators (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1995) or of guardianship (Cohen and Felson, 1979), and several studies have found that they influenced crime rates in an area (Bernasco and Block, 2011;Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;McCord et al., 2007;Nieuwbeerta et al., 2008;Reynald, 2011).""
  - ""The LISA database (in Dutch: Landelijk Informatiesysteem Arbeidsplaatsen; for more information, see Steenbeek et al., 2012), which contains information on businesses and other facilities where paid work is done, was used to obtain crime year-specific information about several area characteristics in each postal code area in the greater The Hague area.""

  - ""The results presented, in particular the finding that repeat offenders are attracted to locations in the proximity of where they recently committed a crime, is consistent with the finding that the same offenders are involved in the majority of (near-) repeat cases (Bernasco, 2008;Johnson, Summers, and Pease, 2009).""
  - ""The current findings are important for police surveillance and criminal investigations. First, and in line with recommendations based on findings about repeat victimization and the contagion of victimization risk, future offenses may be prevented by increasing surveillance in the targeted area in the wake of an offense.""

- ""The available data on the attributes of postal codes is limited and refers mostly to the location, the population (number of residents, age, ethnic composition), and the residential units (number of properties and average value) in the area."" (Data quality)
- ""The use of small spatial units implies a potentially greater role for spatial interaction between observational units, and thus requires the use of statistical methods that are able to capture this spatial interaction."" (Spatial limitations)
- ""The main criterion for choosing a particular unit of analysis is the theory to be tested."" (Theory–method)
- ""The ecological fallacy (Robinson 1950) is the reasoning error by which conclusions about small units are made on the basis of empirical findings at higher levels of aggregation."" (Spatial limitations)
- ""The unit of analysis should match the theory (Weisburd et al. 2009b)."" (Theory–method)
- ""The postal code area unit well fits the qualifications of a behavior setting (Barker 1968; Wicker 1987) or setting (Wikstro ¨m 2006)."" (Theory–method)

Overall Limitation Summary: The study is limited by the availability of data attributes for postal code areas and the potential for ecological fallacy when using small spatial units. However, the choice of postal code areas is theoretically justified as they align with the focus on small-scale natural units of interaction.","  - ""The empirical analysis distinguishes small residential areas approximately the size of a football field, containing only 18 residential units and 40 residents on average.""
  - ""The postal code system was created with the facilitation of postal delivery services in mind. Therefore, a single postal code is nearly always on the same street, applies to adjacent properties, and is not subdivided by physical barriers that impede pedestrian or car transportation.""
  - ""The postal codes in the area comprise 18 addresses on average.""
  - ""the study area (Greater The Hague Area) measures 400 sq. km, and houses a population of 1,000,000 residents in 460,000 residential units.""
  - ""The available data on the attributes of postal codes is limited and refers mostly to the location, the population (number of residents, age, ethnic composition), and the residential units (number of properties and average value) in the area.""

  - ""the main criterion for choosing a particular unit of analysis is the theory to be tested.""
  - ""The ecological fallacy (Robinson 1950) is the reasoning error by which conclusions about small units are made on the basis of empirical findings at higher levels of aggregation.""
  - ""The unit of analysis should match the theory (Weisburd et al. 2009b""",,"- The study uses small residential areas, specifically postal code areas, as the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA). These areas are approximately the size of a football field and contain 18 residential units and 40 residents on average.
- The rationale for choosing postal code areas as the SUoA is not explicitly stated in terms of a specific category like data availability or prior research. However, the paper discusses the theoretical justification for using small spatial units, emphasizing that they are more appropriate for capturing the spatial interaction and are aligned with theoretical notions of offender behavior and target attractiveness.
- The use of postal code areas is justified by their natural fit as a unit of analysis for residential burglary, as they typically refer to a single street or block face, which aligns with the theoretical focus on small-scale natural units of interaction.
- The paper also mentions that the main criterion for choosing a particular unit of analysis is the theory to be tested, indicating that the choice of postal code areas is theoretically driven."

Contemporary work on crime at places (Lee et al. 2017;Weisburd et al. 2009) emphasizes the heterogeneity of such large units and suggests that crime better be studied at more fine-grained resolutions, such as streets, street segments or parcels, as this could better reflect the very local nature of crime attractors and generators and guardianship.""
Category: Spatial limitations
Summary: The use of wards as spatial units may not capture fine-grained variations in crime patterns due to their large size.

REASONING:

1. **Independent Variables**: The independent variables are extracted from the tables provided in the paper. These include variables related to time intervals between robberies, distance to prior robbery locations, and whether the offender was arrested in the act of a prior robbery. These variables are critical for testing the hypotheses about factors influencing subsequent crime location choices.

2. **Spatial Unit of Analysis (SUoA)**: The study uses communities as the spatial unit of analysis, with a total of 1973 communities in the study area. The average size of these communities is 1.62 km². The rationale for choosing this spatial unit is not explicitly stated in terms of data availability or theoretical considerations, but it is implied that this level of analysis is suitable for capturing community-level characteristics that influence crime location choices.

3. **Rationale for SUoA**: The paper does not provide a clear rationale for why communities were chosen as the spatial unit of analysis. However, it can be inferred that this choice allows for the examination of community characteristics as decision-making criteria for offenders, which aligns with the study's focus on understanding crime location choices.

4. **Variables**: The tables provide detailed information on the variables used in the study, including demographic characteristics of offenders, temporal aspects of crimes, and community-level factors."

- The study uses Statistical Area 2 (SA2) Census Units as the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA). This choice is explicitly justified by the need to balance between ignoring spatial spill-over mechanisms and spatial heterogeneity. This means that SA2s are chosen to capture neighborhood-level effects without losing important variations within larger units.

  - ""Although smaller units of analysis minimize within-unit heterogeneity, the census tract was chosen as the spatial unit of analysis because it was the lowest level of aggregation for which the ""collective efficacy"" measure was available and because computationally the use of the resource-intensive discrete choice model with smaller spatial units of analysis would have required a drastic reduction in sample size.""

## DATA LIMITATIONS  
- ""This is a limitation of the method that applies to all studies of this kind but it is a necessary one. The reason is that the approach to analysis requires that all alternatives in the choice set (areas that are and are not selected) be enumerated for the purposes of parameter estimation."" (Methodological)
- ""The dependency in the data associated with reoffending has the potential to lead to errors of statistical inference."" (Methodological)
- ""Second, it is perhaps surprising that the control variables used here-the number of vehicles in an area and the number of car parks-appeared to have little or no influence on offender spatial decision making."" (Data quality)
- ""Finally, while we examined the influence on offender spatial target choice of some of the routine activity nodes of which offenders might be collectively aware (i.e., city centers, rail stations, and schools), we considered the role of only one that was specific to offenders-the home location.""

This is a limitation of the method that applies to all studies of this kind but it is a necessary one. The reason is that the approach to analysis requires that all alternatives in the choice set (areas that are and are not selected) be enumerated for the purposes of parameter estimation.""
  - ""The dependency in the data associated with reoffending has the potential to lead to errors of statistical inference.

- The study acknowledges limitations related to data quality and methodological constraints, such as excluding crimes committed by offenders outside the study area and the potential for errors in statistical inference due to reoffending.
- The study also notes limitations in terms of data quality, such as the lack of influence from certain control variables and the focus on specific routine activity nodes.

Overall Limitation Summary: The study is limited by its focus on a single city, which affects generalizability, and issues with arrest data completeness.","  - ""The current study extends crime pattern theory and addresses this gap in the co-offending literature by considering whether the distribution of co-offences across census block groups in Baltimore City (Maryland) is related to measures of activity nodes and 'connected' street networks, net of the solo crime rate.""

  - ""The Baltimore City Police Department (BPD) releases publicly accessible data on all adult arrests on an annual basis, including information regarding the arrest charge, arrest location, arrest date and time-which allows for the identification of cooffences-and the incident location.""
  - ""We merged the 2013-16 geocoded arrest data with data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2 . The EPA has a publicly available Smart Location Database that includes a wide range of contextual information about census block groups across the entire United States.""
  - ""Data on specific activity nodes (i.e., bars, schools, transit) were provided by publicly available geo-coded data from the Baltimore City Open Data Portal.""
  - ""Data on shopping centres were not included in the data portal, so these were geocoded using Google Map search capabilities.""
  - ""to account for several other contextual covariates (i.e., population, ethnic heterogeneity, population turnover, poverty) related to criminal offending at the macro-level, data from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau was used (U.S. Census Bureau 2016).""
  - ""The average census block group in Baltimore has 2.4 census blocks, is .14 square miles, and has an average of 953 residents.""
  - ""In this way, whereas frequent movement through streets via a vehicle may increase one's knowledge of local criminal opportunities and therefore become part of one's awareness space, such routines are unlikely to foster the discovery of potential accomplices.""
  - ""The fact that only pedestrian-oriented (as opposed to auto-oriented) street connectivity significantly predicted rates of group crime across the census block groups provides preliminary evidence for the type of connectivity that may facilitate group behaviour.""
  - ""There are several limitations to the current study that warrant consideration. First, the study relies on data from a single city which limits the generalizability of these findings.""
  - ""the current study's unit of analysis was a census block group. Although prior co-offending research has used similar or larger geographic areas, advances within crime pattern theory have demonstrated the importance of even smaller microunits that may more fully represent Felson (2003) description of convergence spaces (e.g., Weisburd et al. 2012).""
  - ""Next, a portion of the arrest data from the Baltimore City Open Data Portal did not include or had problematic incident location information leading to incomplete geocoding of arrests.""

**Data Limitations:**
[Quote 1]: ""One point of possible critique on our design is that it assumes that burglaries are profitable and therefore provide incentives for returning to the previous target area."" (Page X)  
Category: Methodological  
Summary: Assumes profitability of burglaries without considering unsuccessful attempts.

[Quote 2]: ""A substantial percentage of burglaries are committed by groups of burglars...the role of other offenders...is ignored."" (Page X)  
Category: Methodological  
Summary: Ignores co-offending dynamics in location choice analysis.

**Overall Limitation Summary:** The study's methodological limitations include assumptions about burglary profitability and the exclusion of co-offending dynamics, which may affect the interpretation of findings.","  - ""The study reported here aims to further explore questions of repeat crime location choices and differs in three key aspects from the study by Lammers et al. (2015). First, it used data from another country (United Kingdom). Second, it used a smaller spatial unit of analysis. Whereas Lammers et al. (2015) used areas with an average population of 7,000 residents, the areas used here have an average population of only 1,500, potentially providing for more homogeneous spatial units and enhanced ecological validity.""
  - ""As a compromise, we decided to use the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) geography as the basic spatial unit of analysis. LSOAs are defined on the basis of proximity and social homogeneity measures (type of dwelling and nature of tenure) and have a population of approximately 1,500 residents and 600 households.""
  - ""The concept of crime location choice presumes spatial units of analysis, which are the alternative locations that burglars choose from when deciding on where to commit a burglary.""
  - ""The estimated model parameters (odds ratios, confidence intervals, and significance level indicators) are listed in Table A1 in the Appendix.""
  - ""To prevent a temporal edge effect it was necessary to assure that for each burglary the data would allow us to look back over a fixed period of time to establish the offender's previous burglaries.""
  - ""The following variables were available for analysis for each burglary: a unique identifier for the offender involved; the time and date of the burglary; the address and geographic grid coordinates of the burglary (accurate to a resolution of one meter); and spatial coordinates for the home address of the offender at the time of the burglary (also accurate to a resolution of one meter).""
  - ""To test the hypotheses, a discrete spatial crime location choice approach is used (Bernasco et al., 2013;Bernasco & Ruiter, 2014) in which every burglary is conceptualized as a discrete choice amongst all 1,687 LSOAs in the study area, and a multinomial logit model is used to estimate the relative weight of each of the LSOA characteristics in the burglar's decision.""",,"- The study uses the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) as the spatial unit of analysis. This choice is justified by the need for more homogeneous spatial units and enhanced ecological validity, as LSOAs are defined based on proximity and social homogeneity measures.
- The rationale for choosing LSOAs is explicitly stated as providing more homogeneous spatial units, which enhances ecological validity. This suggests a theory-method rationale, as the choice is made to improve the validity of the study's findings by using units that better capture the social and spatial characteristics relevant to the study.
- The study uses a discrete spatial crime location choice approach, with each burglary conceptualized as a discrete choice among all 1,687 LSOAs in the study area. This method allows for the estimation of the relative weight of each LSOA characteristic in the burglar's decision-making process.
- The independent variables are extracted from the regression tables and include factors such as prior burglary in the same LSOA or MSOA, distance to the burglar's home, presence of bus and train stations, distance to the city center, number of households, mean house price, ethnic diversity, and population turnover."

Title: ROLE OF THE STREET NETWORK IN BURGLARS' SPATIAL DECISION-MAKING  
Year: 2017  
Authors: Michael J Frith, Shane D Johnson, Hannah M Fry

## CONTEXT  
Country: United Kingdom  
City/Region: High Wycombe and nearby Beaconsfield and Marlow in Buckinghamshire  
Study Area Size (km²): 150  
Crime Type(s): Residential burglaries  
Study Period: 04/01/2004 to 03/31/2014  
Data Sources: Thames Valley Police (TVP), Ordnance Survey (OS)

## SUoA  
Type: Street segment  
Size: Not specified  
#Units: 5,286  
Pop./Unit: Not specified  
Quoted Rationale: ""For example, people do not navigate from one large area to another; they navigate along the road network. As such, a spatial resolution at this scale (e.g., street segment) should better capture the spatial logic of offender decision-making (Johnson and Bowers, 2010). Also, as constructs such as (the potential for) guardianship and awareness spaces can be more precisely measured at this level, street segments are a natural unit for studying crime (Weisburd, Groff, and Yang, 2012).""  
Rationale Category: Theory–method  
Rationale Summary: The street segment level was chosen because it better captures the spatial logic of offender decision-making and allows for more precise measurement of guardianship and awareness spaces.

## METHODS  
Design: Discrete choice approach  
Stat Method: Mixed logit model  
Model Type: Mixed logit  
Software: Stata

## KEY FINDINGS  
Main Results: The study found that street segments that are quicker to travel to and more familiar to an offender are more likely to be selected for burglary. Nonlocal pedestrian traffic was associated with an increase in burglary risk, while local pedestrian traffic was associated with a decrease.  
Significant Predictors: Idiosyncratic farness, idiosyncratic betweenness, local pedestrian betweenness, nonlocal pedestrian betweenness, vehicular betweenness  
Model Performance: The mixed logit model fit the data significantly better than the null model and conditional logit models.  
Scale Effects: The study highlights the importance of using a finer spatial scale like street segments to capture the spatial logic of offender decision-making.

## DATA LIMITATIONS  
- ""It is also important to acknowledge limitations associated with the police data analyzed here. Not all crimes are recorded by, or cleared by, the police, and consequently, the current findings may only apply to the sample of offenders who came to the attention of the police.""  
Category: Data quality  
Summary: The study's findings may be limited by the incomplete recording and clearance of crimes by the police.

**Overall Limitation Summary:** The study's findings may not generalize to all offenders due to limitations in police-recorded crime data.","  - ""The study area was defined by identifying the ""built-up areas"" of the three towns and by applying a 1-km buffer around them (for a map of the study area, see appendix A in the online supporting information 1 ). The resulting study area covers a geography of approximately 150 km 2 and includes 81,682 dwellings situated on 5,286 street segments.""
  - ""The aim of prior research has been to examine the role of the road network on crime, but it has failed to isolate the influence of these two mechanisms. This is largely because analyses have been conducted to examine only the location of crime events, without reference to the offenders involved.""
  - ""Our research differs from previous studies of offender spatial decision-making in two important ways. First, in most previous studies, scholars have examined offender location choice at the area level (for the exceptions, see Bernasco, 2010b, and Vandeviver et al., 2015). Here, consistent with contemporary theory (Weisburd, Groff, and Yang, 2012) and the research questions at hand, we do so at the street segment level.""
  - ""For example, people do not navigate from one large area to another; they navigate along the road network. As such, a spatial resolution at this scale (e.g., street segment) should better capture the spatial logic of offender decision-making (Johnson and Bowers, 2010). Also, as constructs such as (the potential for) guardianship and awareness spaces can be more precisely measured at this level, street segments are a natural unit for studying crime (Weisburd, Groff, and Yang, 2012).""
  - ""The application of the discrete choice framework requires the specification of the decision-makers, the choice-set, and the choice criterion. In studies of crime location choice, the decision-makers are clearly offenders, and the criteria are those factors hypothesized to influence targeting decisions.""
  - ""For parsimony, table 3 shows the results for the key variables of interest, along with the model fits from the ML models.""
  - ""The findings from qualitative research concerned with burglars' use of space (e.g., Rengert and Wasilchick, 2000;Wiles and Costello, 2000) has revealed that different activity nodes, such as schools for younger burglars and the workplace for older offenders, influence offender spatial decision-making.""
  - ""It is also important to acknowledge limitations associated with the police data analyzed here. Not all crimes are recorded by, or cleared by, the police, and consequently, the current findings may only apply to the sample of offenders who came to the attention of the police.""",,"- The study area is defined by the ""built-up areas"" of three towns with a 1-km buffer, covering approximately 150 km² and including 81,682 dwellings on 5,286 street segments.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is the street segment level, chosen because it better captures the spatial logic of offender decision-making and allows for more precise measurement of guardianship and awareness spaces.
- The study uses a discrete choice approach to estimate how opportunities targeted by burglars differ from those not targeted, focusing on the street segment level to improve upon previous area-level studies.
- The rationale for choosing the street segment level is based on the idea that people navigate along the road network, and this scale is more appropriate for studying crime location choice.
- The study includes various independent variables such as idiosyncratic farness, idiosyncratic betweenness, local pedestrian betweenness, nonlocal pedestrian betweenness, vehicular betweenness, ethnic heterogeneity, residential turnover, socioeconomic heterogeneity, affluence, and the number of dwellings.
- The study acknowledges limitations related to data quality, specifically that not all crimes are recorded or cleared by the police, which may affect the generalizability of the findings."

These limitations affect the interpretation and generalizability of findings.","  - ""The final offence and offender datasets comprised 150 attacks by 127 PIRA members within Belfast.""
  - ""Since 2011, Northern Ireland has been divided into 4537 'Small Areas' (hereafter, SAs), which are currently the smallest areal unit.""
  - ""SAs were designed specifically for statistical purposes and follow physical features of the environment such as roads and rivers (NISRA).""
  - ""As no sociodemographic variables were included in the analysis, it was deemed that SAs would be appropriate to use, and they therefore formed the choice set of alternatives for this study""
  - ""The geographical boundary data for the SAs was obtained from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).""
  - ""The datasets were created using parts of an existing dataset previously used for a social network analysis of PIRA's active core members (Gill et al., 2014), as well as additional data obtained from The Irish Times newspaper archives.""
  - ""The location of each attack was geocoded to the corresponding SA.""
  - ""The discrete choice approach (McFadden, 1974) can appropriately model between a set of two or more discrete alternatives, based on the utility the offender expects to derive from each alternative (Train, 2003).""
  - ""the set of alternatives takes the form of SAs in Belfast, Northern

Ireland and the expected utility of each potential target area is assumed to be evaluated according to the decision criteria presented above.""
  - ""The conditional logit model tested the hypotheses.""
  - ""The model provided a satisfactory level of fit, with a McFadden pseudo-R 2 value of 0.178.""
  - ""The likelihood-ratio test (p<0.001) of the model demonstrates that it fits the data better than the null model.""
  - ""Three of the parameters significantly contributed to the predictive capacity of the model.""
  - ""The coefficient of the first distance parameter is in line with hypothesis 1.""
  - ""The estimated effects of a river acting as a natural barrier (hypothesis 3) were in the right direction, but not statistically significant""
  - ""In line with hypothesis 4, the presence of a major road was associated with target choice, increasing the likelihood of the SA being chosen as a target by a factor of 1.77 (p<.001).""
  - ""As predicted, the presence of a military base or police station increased the likelihood that the area would be chosen as a target (e  = 13.78, p<.001).""
  - ""The findings are very promising and provide further support that terrorists behave similarly to 'traditional' criminals in terms of spatial decision making when selecting targets.""
  - ""The results demonstrate the characteristics of the target SAs as well as the properties of their likely journey to the target influenced the location of PIRA attacks.""
  - ""The model indicated that three of the variables affected the likelihood of a SA being chosen as a target.""
  - ""An increase in distance from the home location decreased the likelihood that the SA would be chosen.""
  - ""The presence of a major road in the SA also increased the likelihood that the SA would be selected.""
  - ""The same was true for the presence of a military base or police station.""
  - ""Distance is highlighted as an important factor in target selection, which is consistent with previous studies of terrorist activity""
  - ""The results illustrate the impact of distance decay, with perpetrators less likely to select an area as distance from the home increases, most likely due to the changes in required effort.""
  - ""The identifiable effects of the distance variables could be extremely beneficial for investigative techniques, especially when a threat is made against a specific target""
  - ""Something that could be taken into consideration in future analyses is the mode of transport to and from each attack.""
  - ""Contrary to expectations, an association between target selection and distance from the city centre was not supported.""
  - ""No support was found for the idea that rivers can act as physical 'barriers', which contrasts with previous research in the study of urban crimes""
  - ""The presence of a military base or police station increased the likelihood of an SA being targeted.""
  - ""Regarding connectivity, and consistent with the findings of Ozer and Akbas (2011), the presence of a major thoroughfare increased the likelihood of an area being chosen.""
  - ""These variables are also analogous with the offender's likely familiarity of the area""
  - ""As with many quantitative studies of terrorism and political violence there are a number of constraints associated with the data used in this study.""
  - ""Some difficulties were encountered due to the historical nature of the records used.""
  - ""Typically, similar studies that implement this model to traditional crimes also analyse social context factors in order to further examine environmental criminological theories.""
  - ""It was not possible to test the function of such factors and others (e.g. affluence levels), as appropriate figures were unavailable.""
  - ""The authors initially wanted to consider the residential segregation of Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland.""
  - ""due to the retrospective nature of this study it was not possible to get this information for the period studied at small areas level.""
  - ""As a result, the decision was made to exclude potential social context variables.""
  - ""This is a complete analysis of core Belfast PIRA members convicted of an attack where both the home and attack locations are known.""
  - ""It is a comprehensive dataset for the city with respect to the most important and highly connected members of PIRA (Gill et al., 2014).""
  - ""However, it is not a complete dataset of all PIRA activity in Belfast during this period as several attacks that were identified from the Irish Times archive had to be excluded from the dataset.""
  - ""The main reason for this was because they could not be directly attributed to a specific individual.""
  - ""Also, due to the underlying mechanisms of this model, the data had to be restricted to one city.""
  - ""It was also necessary to omit attacks in Belfast committed by non-residents and incidents outside of Belfast committed by Belfast residents from the sample, thus the effects of the distance variables may be underestimated.""
  - ""This dataset is a slightly smaller sample in comparison to most previous similar studies of crime.""
  - ""There may be some parameter inflation and there is the possibility of skewing of distributions to values higher than the true odds ratio.""
  - ""Although the sample used in this study was deemed sufficient for the implementation of the model (Greenland et al., 2000), utilisation of a larger sample size would have been preferable.""
  - ""As well as improving the power and reliability of the model, a larger dataset would have enabled further hypothesis testing.""
  - ""Areal unit boundaries are arbitrary and lack ecological meaning (Bursik, 1986) and the characteristic data used may not be an accurate representation of the perceptions of those living in the areas (Coulton et al., 2001).""
  - ""Smaller units would enable factors such as the effects of social disorganisation to be touched upon, if the data was available.""
  - ""The theoretical notions apply to much smaller units and the street block is the most appropriate unit for analysis (Taylor, 1997).""
  - ""However, larger areal units such as small areas relax the effects of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) which is a consideration of the conditional logit estimation.""
  - ""As well as the necessity of replicating this study using other cities in Northern Ireland where PIRA were in operation, further studies should examine different terrorist groups to identify how transferable the effects are to different contexts.""
  - ""A good comparison would be another organisation with similar targeting patterns, for example Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA).""
  - ""Groups with different ideologies should also be studied, to increase the model's generalisability.""
  - ""There are several ways this study could be improved and expanded on through the further disaggregation of data.""
  - ""Initially, we aimed to distinguish between different types of targets (i.e.

attacks on premises and attacks on individuals), as different types of crimes tend to exhibit different spatial patterns (Andresen and Linning, 2012).""
  - ""However, there was insufficient data to do so.""
  - ""Differences between males and females could be examined as well as modes of attack (bombings, shootings, arson etc.) and types of human target, i.e. military/government/civilian.""
  - ""Other models, such as a mixed logit (McFadden and Train, 2000) or latent class model, could be considered in future studies.""
  - ""The mixed logit also accounts for idiosyncratic variations as it is likely that individuals place different emphases on certain attributes, for example distance (Robinson 1950).""
  - ""Disparities in the attacks of different terrorists could be looked at, in particular for PIRA where there were variations in the skill sets of members.""
  - ""Gill et al. (2017) found differences between different roles in the group (in this case shooters and IED planters),

i.e. IED planters travelled longer distances to attacks.""
  - ""The use of a mixed logit or latent class model would also relax the effects of IIA.""
  - ""Temporal variations are often neglected in criminological research (Ratcliffe, 2006).""
  - ""Using a model of spatiotemporal choice as opposed to spatial choice may demonstrate that certain types of attacks were more likely to occur on certain days of the week, or certain times of day (included in the set of alternatives), and improve the understanding of target selection.""
  - ""For example, PIRA tended to avoid attacks on Saturdays as fewer people would hear about it on the news on a Sunday, and attacks were often tailored to fit in with the working and social schedules of members (Collins, 1998).""
  - ""Terrorism is not static (Drake, 1998), and PIRA's structure and strategy underwent many changes throughout their campaign (Asal et al., 2013; Gill and Horgan, 2013).""
  - ""Future research could incorporate distinctions between the different phases of PIRA activity, to see if changes in strategy were reflected in variations in target patterning.""
  - ""It may also be interesting to examine differences between different groups in the same conflict.""
  - ""The effects of repeat and near repeat victimisation could also be taken into consideration.""
  - ""Studies of traditional crimes tell us that a crime event at one location increases the risk of a further event in the immediate vicinity and within a short time span (Johnson et al., 2007).""
  - ""This pattern has also been found when examining insurgent activity in Iraq (Townsley et al., 2008)""
  - ""Taking the discrete choice approach, Bernasco et al. (2015) and Lammers et al. (2015) found that offenders were more likely to offend in areas they had previously targeted than other areas they had not targeted before.""
  - ""Using this approach to identify the effects of repeat and nearrepeat patterns in terrorist attacks could be extremely useful for prevention and disruption strategies in the anticipation of further attacks.""","  - ""(Page 18, Table 1) | Variable                              |  eβ      | z    |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|------|\n| Distance (km)                         | 0.61***  | -7.5 |""

- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is defined as 'Small Areas' (SAs), which are the smallest areal unit in Northern Ireland, designed for statistical purposes and following physical features like roads and rivers.
- The rationale for choosing SAs as the SUoA is that they are appropriate for statistical analysis and follow physical features, which is relevant for understanding spatial decision making.
- The study includes several independent variables: distance from home to attack site, distance to city centre, presence of a river (natural barrier), presence of a major road (connectivity), and presence of a military base or police station.
- The study uses a conditional logistic regression model to determine which characteristics increase the likelihood of an area being selected as a target.
- The findings support that terrorists make decisions guided by rationality, similar to urban criminals, and are influenced by factors like distance, connectivity, and presence of military or police targets.

  - ""The present article seeks to contribute to the knowledge about how spatial crime patterns depend on the time of the day and the day of the week.""
  - ""The analysis is limited to cleared robberies because only for cleared robberies offender addresses are available, and distance from the offender home location is by far the most important predictive factor in crime location choice""
  - ""the data include both the location where the offender lived and the location where the robbery was committed.""
  - ""The sample excludes robberies committed by Chicago residents outside their city, but Bernasco et al. (2013) demonstrated that this selection does not produce biased estimates.""
  - ""The data further exclude a few street robberies that are perpetrated on expressways (covered by the state police) and robberies on college campuses (covered by the university's police).""
  - ""The data also exclude Chicago robberies committed by persons who are not residents of Chicago, but this is an exclusion by design, as our sample applies to residents of Chicago.""
  - ""To measure small-scale retail activities in the block, we used marketing information collected by Claritas (now part of marketing research firm Nielsen) on businesses in the city of Chicago during the same period the crime data were recorded.""
  - ""To measure the local presence of illegal retail activities, in particular drugs dealing, prostitution, and illegal gambling, geocoded incident files of the Chicago Police Department of the years 1996 to 1998 were aggregated to the census block level.""
  - ""The accessibility of a block was measured by two indicator variables, namely, (13) whether the block is located along at least one main street (rather than only minor streets) and ( 14) whether the block contains a station of the El, the Chicago elevated railway system (also known as ""L"").""
  - ""Data on (15) the presence of private and public high schools in a census block were based on lists compiled by the Chicago Public Schools.""
  - ""Data on block population was obtained from the U.S. 2000 Census.""
  - ""Euclidian distances were calculated between the homes of the offenders and the midpoints of each of the 24,594 census blocks.""
  - ""The distances between offender homes and robbery locations within their own census block of residence was approximated by half the square root of the census block surface, which is about the average distance between two random points in a rectangle of the same size as the block surface""
  - ""the negative value of the log of distance was included in the model.""
  - ""the conditional logit model was used to estimate the effects of census block attributes on the probability of the census block being selected for robbery.""
  - ""To explore temporal differences in location preference, 12 models were estimated separately for each of 12 two-hour blocks (4-6 a.m., 6-8 a.m., 8-10 a.m., etc.) and 7 models were estimated separately for each of the seven days of the week.""

  - ""Police records were screened for evidence of crime involvement of the 517 participants who consented that additional information about them be collected.""
  - ""The police records allowed detailed reconstruction of the respondents' criminal records (i.e., which offenses they had been charged with and the times and locations of these offenses).""
  - ""The findings reported in Fig 3 provide support for most of the six hypotheses.""
  - ""The findings demonstrate that in addition to activity space, criminal opportunity is relevant in its own right for explaining and predicting where crimes take place, even if we condition on offenders' activity spaces and prior crime locations.""
  - ""The findings presented here will not directly help prevent crime, because they do not inform us about who the prospective offenders are and when they will commit crimes.""
  - ""The reported findings can be particularly useful in criminal investigations, when crimes have taken place and the police searches for the identity and whereabouts of the offenders using geographic profiling,""",,"- The study uses a spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) that is based on a grid system, with each grid cell being 200x200m.

REASONING:

- The study uses the house as the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) to focus on the specific attributes that influence burglars' decisions at the most granular level possible, which is the individual house.
- The choice of East Flanders as the study area is due to its large and diverse population, which provides a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- The rationale for using the house as the SUoA is to address previous research limitations that used larger spatial units like neighborhoods, which do not align with the actual decision-making process of burglars who ultimately select individual houses.
- The study area is chosen for its size and diversity, allowing for a more robust analysis compared to previous studies that focused on smaller or less diverse areas."

## DATA QUALITY  
Variable Info: Complete  
Missing Info: Not specified  
Confidence: High","  - ""Collecting fresh, micro-level data using Google Street View (GSV) as a tool of Systematic Social Observation (SSO), we utilise a case-control design to isolate property-level effects.""
  - ""The ease of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are all positively related to burglary risk.""
  - ""There is no evidence that indications of resident wealth are related to the likelihood of victimisation, or that the effect of surveillability varies depending on the extent of collective efficacy in a neighbourhood.""
  - ""The surveillability of residential units refers to the extent to which a home is visible to third parties, in particular passers-by and neighbours, who may act as guardians""
  - ""Property accessibility was measured through seven items, namely (1) whether the property was at the end of a row of properties, (2) number of boundaries the property shared with public areas, (3) whether the private space of the property could be sealed off with physical barriers, (4) whether the property has a burglar alarm, (5) whether the property was setback from the street, (6) the age of the building and ( 7) whether the property had amenities, such as plant pots and benches, on public space directly outside the unit.""
  - ""Wealth was measured with three items, namely (1) whether the property had a garage, (2) the size of the property in square metres, and (3) the external condition of the property.""
  - ""Ease of escape was measured with three items, namely (1) the distance between the property and the nearest main road, (2) the distance between the property and the nearest street corner, and (3) the number of escape routes, including footpaths, leading off the street segment.""
  - ""Three variables were used as control variables. One binary variable indicated whether there was a business present in the immediate surrounding area open during daylight hours: we aimed to control for the 'eyes on the street' that nearby businesses might generate. Mixed land-use was a binary variable indicating whether the immediate surrounding area had land usage beyond that of purely residential, such as a car park. House type was a categorical variable stating whether the house was terraced, semi-detached, or detached.""
  - ""The outcome variable in this study was whether or not a residential unit was burgled in The Hague during the year 2009.""
  - ""The explanatory variables on the property-level were primarily collected based a variety of GSV images, which allows users to 'move' up and down the street to get different angles of the property, including nearby streets from which the unit is visible.""
  - ""The items collected using SSO were selected for the purposes of objectively measuring the four principle concepts deemed particularly prominent in offender-based research.""
  - ""The data collection technique is not without its drawbacks. The inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a bias sample, as these cannot be coded.""
  - ""A resolvable issue for future research would be an exploration into whether behaviour varies depending on the time of day (e.g. Montoya, Junger, & Ongena, 2016).""
  - ""It is worthwhile noting that this study cannot claim to have infallibly replicated the experience of a burglar selecting a suitable target.""",,"- The study uses a case-control design to isolate property-level effects, indicating that the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is at the property level.
- The study focuses on physical attributes of residential homes and their immediate surrounding area, which aligns with the property-level SUoA.
- The use of Google Street View for data collection suggests that the SUoA is chosen for its ability to provide detailed, micro-level data on individual properties.
- The study does not explicitly state why the property level was chosen, but it implies that it is due to the availability of detailed data through Google Street View and the focus on property-level attributes.
- The independent variables include surveillability, accessibility, wealth, and ease of escape, which are all measured at the property level.
- Control variables include business presence, mixed land-use, and house type, which are also relevant at the property level."
