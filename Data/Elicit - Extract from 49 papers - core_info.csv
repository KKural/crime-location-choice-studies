## CONTEXT  
Country: United Kingdom  
City/Region: London  
Study Area Size (km²): Not specified  
Crime Type(s): Rioting  
Study Period: August 6-11, 2011  
Data Sources: Metropolitan Police Service, U.K. Census, U.K. Department for Communities and Local Government

## SUoA  
Type: Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs)  
Size: Not specified  
#Units: 4,765  
Pop./Unit: Approximately 1,500 residents  
Quoted Rationale: ""The advantage of smaller sized units of analysis in the discrete choice approach is that the explanatory variables are more representative of the population and characteristics of each area.""

Rationale Summary: LSOAs were chosen because they provide a more detailed and representative analysis of population and area characteristics, which is essential for understanding the spatial dynamics of rioting.

## METHODS  
Design: Discrete spatial choice model  
Stat Method: Random utility model  
Model Type: Conditional logit model  
Software: STATA 10 SE  
Sampling: Not specified  
Sample Size (choices): 2,299 records  
Choice Set: LSOAs in Greater London

## VARIABLES

DEMOGRAPHIC:  
  - Population density
  - Ethnic diversity
ECONOMIC:  
  - Deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation)
CRIME ATTRACTORS:

## VARIABLE COUNTS  
Demo: 2 | Econ: 1 | Crime Attractors: 3 | Distance: 2 | Temporal: 1 | Other: 1

## KEY FINDINGS  
Main Results: Rioters were more likely to target areas close to their residence, with schools, transport links, and retail facilities. Areas with recent rioting were also more likely to be targeted.  
Significant Predictors: Proximity to residence, presence of schools, underground stations, retail floor space, previous offenses.  
Model Performance: Pseudo R² values between .31 and .36 indicate a good fit.  
Scale Effects: Smaller geographic units (LSOAs) provided more representative data.

## DATA LIMITATIONS EXTRACTION

Data Limitations:
Quote 1: ""The estimates of population churn rates and ethnic heterogeneity were derived using data from the 2001 U.K. Census."" 
Category: Temporal limitations
Summary: The use of outdated census data may not accurately reflect current demographic conditions.

Quote 2: ""Unfortunately, data regarding police activity were unavailable for analysis, and so we could not estimate the effect of police officer presence, or the number of arrests made in an area during the riots, on offender spatial decision making.""
Category: Data quality
Summary: Lack of data on police activity limits understanding of its impact on rioter behavior.

Overall Limitation Summary: The study's reliance on outdated census data and lack of police activity data may affect the accuracy and completeness of its findings.","  - ""To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police.""
  - ""Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making.""
  - ""The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular.""
  - ""For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River.""
  - ""In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours.""
  - ""The results suggest an unequivocal effect of propinquity (hypothesis 1) on offender spatial decision making, with offenders (young or old) being more likely to target areas that were closer to their area of residence.""
  - ""Considering potential (collective) routine activity nodes, all other things being equal, the odds of an offender selecting an area increases by a factor of between 1.29 and 2.09 for every additional school that is located within it (hypothesis 3).""
  - ""Considering the accessibility of an area, or connectivity via the tube network (hypothesis 4), all other things being equal, in line with CPT the presence of a tube station was a statistically significant predictor of whether an area was selected for August 7 and 9.""
  - ""In terms of proximity to the city center (hypothesis 6), the patterns were more ambiguous.""
  - ""Considering the variables associated with social disorganization, the odds ratios were generally in line with expectation, but the results were mixed.""
  - ""The variable used to measure contagion (hypothesis 11)-indicating the number of offenses in each area in the previous 24 hours-was significantly associated with target choice during the London riots, as expected.""
  - ""The estimates of population churn rates and ethnic heterogeneity were derived using data from the 2001 U.K. Census.""
  - ""To measure deprivation, we use the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010 obtained from the U.K. Department for Communities and Local Government""
  - ""In addition to the variables discussed, a measure of population density is included in the model.""
  - ""Finally, to measure the effect that prior offenses at a location have on the spatial decision making of a new potential rioter, for each event level decision, we count the number of detected offenses that were identified by the police as having been associated with the riots that occurred at each LSOA within the previous 24 hours of that decision.""
  - ""The results also provide some support for theories of social disorganization as influencing the spatial decision making of rioters.""
  - ""In terms of the mechanism through which social disorganization might have a part to play, as discussed, cohesive neighborhoods might exert control over their residents to reduce the likelihood that they would engage in the disorder.""
  - ""Considering the temporal dynamics of riots, we tested whether recent activity in an area positively influenced the likelihood that other rioters would select that area to engage in disorder.""",,"QUOTES:

- ""The advantage of smaller sized units of analysis in the discrete choice approach is that the explanatory variables are more representative of the population and characteristics of each area.""

REASONING:

- The paper uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze the spatial decision-making of rioters during the 2011 London riots.
- The study's spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is the U.K. census Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs), which are smaller geographic units that allow for more representative explanatory variables.
- The choice of LSOAs is justified by their ability to provide a detailed representation of population and area characteristics, which is crucial for understanding the spatial dynamics of rioting.
- The study examines various independent variables, including the presence of schools, underground stations, retail floor space, distance to the city center, and social disorganization indicators like population churn, ethnic diversity, and deprivation.
- The paper also considers temporal factors, such as previous offenses in an area, to understand the contagion effect in rioting behavior.
- The tables provide detailed statistical results and variable descriptions, which are essential for understanding the model's findings and the significance of different predictors."

Data Limitations:
Quote 1: ""First, as explained previously when discussing the representativeness of the burglary data involved, only a very small percentage of burglaries that occurred were actually included in this analysis."" 
Category: Data quality
Summary: The analysis includes only a small percentage of actual burglaries due to data limitations.

Quote 2: ""Second, due to the artificial nature of defining an external boundary for the discrete choice set in this case, the exclusion of suburbs outside of the Perth metropolitan area has influenced the outcome of this analysis.""
Category: Spatial limitations
Summary: The exclusion of suburbs outside Perth may affect the generalizability of the findings.

Overall Limitation Summary: The study's findings are limited by the small sample size of burglaries included and the exclusion of suburbs outside the Perth metropolitan area, which may affect the representativeness and generalizability of the results.","  - ""The residential burglary data analysed here were provided by the Western Australian Police.""
  - ""The final dataset contained 1,761 singleoffender (actual or attempted) residential burglaries committed between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002 , where the offender resided in the city of Perth.""
  - ""A total of 291 residential suburbs were selected as members of the possible choice set for the residential burglaries examined here.""
  - ""the term suburb as used in Western Australia has a different meaning to other parts of the world (particularly the United States and Canada), and is more akin to a neighbourhood in these areas.""
  - ""The overall geographic placement of these suburbs in relation to the Swan River, selected major roads, and the location of the railway line are displayed in Figure 1""
  - ""The essential elements involved with the application of discrete spatial choice are: (a) defining the boundaries of the choice set, (b) capturing the unique attributes of the decision-makers and (c) modelling the interaction between the individual chooser's characteristics and choice for the whole population""
  - ""The city of Perth is located in the south-west of Western Australia at the coast of the Indian Ocean.""
  - ""Perth is the largest city in Western Australia, with suburbs that sprawl along the coast for approximately 100 km and extend inland from the coast by up to 40 km.""",,"- The study uses data provided by the Western Australian Police, which indicates that the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is determined by the availability of data at the suburb level.
- The choice of suburbs as the spatial unit is also influenced by the administrative definition of suburbs in Western Australia, which is akin to neighborhoods in other parts of the world.
- The study area is defined as the city of Perth, with a focus on residential suburbs, which are used as the choice set for analyzing burglary incidents.
- The rationale for using suburbs as the SUoA is not explicitly stated in terms of theoretical or methodological reasons, but it is implied that data availability and administrative convenience play a role.
- The study involves modeling the interaction between individual characteristics and spatial choices, which aligns with the use of suburbs as a meaningful unit for capturing these dynamics."

The core information includes the independent variables used in the study and the rationale for the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA).

1. **Independent Variables:**
   - The study examines the influence of prior crime locations on subsequent crime location choices. The independent variables include:
     - Frequency of prior crimes in an area.
     - Recency of prior crimes in an area.
     - Proximity of prior crimes to the current crime location.
     - Type of prior crimes (same or different from the current crime).
   - These variables are tested through hypotheses that offenders are more likely to commit crimes in areas they have previously targeted, especially if the crimes are frequent, recent, nearby, and of the same type.

2. **Spatial Unit of Analysis (SUoA):**
   - The study uses four-digit postal code areas as the spatial unit of analysis.
   - The rationale for choosing this SUoA is based on the theory-method category, as it is considered a useful and plausible indication of areas people are familiar with when living in or regularly visiting them. This choice aligns with the theoretical framework of crime pattern theory, which suggests that offenders commit crimes within their awareness space.

3. **Rationale for SUoA:**
   - The paper states: ""As described by Bernasco (2010b), a four-digit postal code area is a useful and plausible indication of the area people are expected to be familiar with when for instance living in or (regularly) visiting that area because 1) Dutch postal code areas are designed to have minimal travel restrictions for postal delivery services usually traveling on foot or bicycle, and 2) the size of a postal code area is inversely related to its level of urbanization that matches the geographic coverage of residents."""

Data Limitations:
Quote 1: ""The data were not specifically sampled to study co-offending, which led to a large number of offenders and offences being removed from the sample."" 
Category: Methodological
Summary: The study's sample was not specifically designed for co-offending analysis, leading to potential biases.

Quote 2: ""The data are limited to the greater The Hague region (offenders from the sample were excluded if they did not reside in this region)."" 
Category: Generalizability
Summary: The study's findings may not be generalizable beyond the greater The Hague region.

Quote 3: ""Awareness space in this study is measured as the current and previous home locations of the offenders, as well as previous crime locations. However, a person's awareness space consists of more areas, e.g. a work location and/or a school location."" 
Category: Data quality
Summary: The measurement of awareness space is limited to certain locations, potentially underestimating the actual awareness space.

Overall Limitation Summary: The study's limitations include a non-specific sample for co-offending analysis, regional constraints limiting generalizability, and a potentially incomplete measurement of awareness spaces.","  - ""The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model.""
  - ""The dependent variable in this study is the choice of an area j from a geographical set of alternatives J to co-offend in.""
  - ""The set of alternatives J in this study contains the 142 four-digit postal code areas of the greater The Hague area.""
  - ""The independent variables home location, previous home location and previous crime location were constructed in a similar way: these variables received a score of 1 when an offender had committed a crime in this postal code area, or was living in the area at the time of the offence, or had lived in the area before.""
  - ""The discrete spatial choice model testing whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in the shared awareness space of the co-offending group includes a number of control variables measuring area characteristics known to influence crime location choice.""
  - ""Statistics Netherlands records socio-demographic and socio-economic information for each postal code area in the Netherlands.""
  - ""The LISA database (see Steenbeek et al. 2012 for more information on the LISA database), a database containing information on businesses, was used to obtain year-postal code area-specific information on the number of retail stores, hotels, restaurants, bars, schools, cultural facilities, health care institutions and sport and leisure facilities.""
  - ""The final sample consisted of 4,654 offenders with at least one cooffended crime in a group of two or three offenders.""
  - ""The residential history of the offenders was derived from population registration data held in a nationwide information system (Dutch acronym is BRP).""
  - ""The dependent variable in this model is the choice of an area j from a geographical set of alternatives J to commit a co-offended crime.""",,"- The study uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze crime location choices, focusing on the choice of postal code areas in the greater The Hague region.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is the four-digit postal code area, which is used to represent areas known to offenders, such as home locations and previous crime locations.
- The rationale for using postal code areas is linked to data availability and the appropriateness of these areas for capturing awareness spaces, as they are used in socio-demographic and socio-economic data collection by Statistics Netherlands.
- The study includes various independent variables, such as current home location, previous home location, and previous crime location, which are measured at the postal code level.
- Control variables include area characteristics like the number of retail stores, hotels, restaurants, bars, schools, cultural facilities, health care institutions, and sport and leisure facilities, sourced from the LISA database."

Category: Methodological  
Summary: Small sample size limits conclusions.

Quote 2: ""Another common limitation of retrospective survey research is that the accuracy of recall from respondents' memory is uncertain.""  
Category: Data quality  
Summary: Uncertainty in recall accuracy.

Quote 3: ""As our respondents were sampled from police register data on suspected offenders from two specific police regions in the western part of the Netherlands (The Hague and Noord-Holland), we might not be able to generalize our findings to the broader offender population; to offenders in other parts of the country or to offenders that escaped arrest.""  
Category: Generalizability  
Summary: Limited generalizability due to sampling from specific regions.

Overall Limitation Summary: The study is limited by a small sample size, potential issues with recall accuracy, and limited generalizability due to the specific sampling regions.","  - ""The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second-and third-order neighbourhoods.""
  - ""The dependent variable crime committed in neighbourhood (1 = yes; 0 = no) indicates whether or not an offence was committed in a specific neighbourhood.""
  - ""The independent variable neighbourhood routinely visited (1 = yes; 0 = no) indicates whether or not a neighbourhood was part of the offenders' activity space in the period before or during the crime event.""
  - ""In order to determine the adequate spatial and temporal resolution for our unit of analysis, we first checked the reported level of accuracy for the seven routine activity domains and the five different reported types of crime.""
  - ""Spatial accuracy was generally higher for the reported routine activity nodes than for the crimes.""
  - ""Therefore, we geocoded the longitude-latitude information to one of the 13,305 unique neighbourhoods in the Netherlands for the year 2018, with a median area of 0.66 km 2 (mean = 2.63, range = 0.02-130.14) (Statistics Netherlands 2019).""
  - ""the final dataset for analysis is a data matrix of 944,655 rows (containing 13,305 neighbourhood rows for each of the 71 crimes to be explained).""
  - ""The results of the conditional logit model that tests whether offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different parts of the day are displayed in Table 2""
  - ""The results suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day, although the effect size difference was not statistically significant in our small sample-but clearly in the expected direction.""",,"- The study uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze crime patterns, focusing on the spatial and temporal aspects of offenders' activity spaces.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is the neighbourhood, as indicated by the geocoding of longitude-latitude information to one of the 13,305 unique neighbourhoods in the Netherlands.
- The rationale for choosing neighbourhoods as the SUoA is not explicitly stated in terms of why this level was chosen, but it is implied by the use of geocoded data and the focus on activity spaces.
- The study includes variables such as whether a neighbourhood was part of the offenders' activity space and whether it was visited at the same or different times of day as the crime event.
- The data limitations include the small sample size and potential issues with recall accuracy, but these are not directly related to the choice of SUoA."

- The use of ArcGIS for geocoding addresses ensures accurate spatial analysis.
- The exclusion of incidents with unknown or incorrect addresses and those outside city boundaries helps maintain data integrity.
- The study uses block groups as the spatial unit of analysis because they are the smallest units with meaningful sociodemographic data available.
- The study employs discrete choice modeling to assess neighborhood characteristics' influence on burglary decisions.
- Limitations include the inability to account for individual suspect characteristics and different land uses, which could affect crime attractors.

Relationships Between Offenders' Crime Locations and Different Prior Activity Locations as Recorded in Police Data,"Sophie Curtis-Ham, Wim Bernasco, Oleg N Medvedev, Devon L L Polaschek",-,-,-,-,-,"- Type: Statistical Area 2 (SA2)
- Size: Median land area of 1.2 km²
- #Units: Not specified
- Pop./Unit: Typically 2000-4000 residents in urban areas and 1000-3000 in rural areas
- Quoted Rationale: ""Selecting the spatial unit involves balancing a range of considerations by the analyst (Bernasco 2010a). These include theoretical relevance (how big is one unit of 'activity space'?), spatial spill-over (if the unit is too small the choice is influenced by the attributes of surrounding units), spatial heterogeneity (if the unit is too big then variation within the unit that could affect the choice is not captured), and computational processing (if there are too many units the capacity of available computing equipment may be exceeded).""
- Rationale Category: Theory–method
- Rationale Summary: The SA2 was chosen to balance theoretical relevance, spatial spill-over, spatial heterogeneity, and computational processing constraints, making it suitable for capturing neighborhood effects in crime pattern analysis.","  - ""The median land area of the sampled SA2s was 1.2km 2 (quartiles 0.84, 2.2 km 2 ) on average across the five offences modelled.""
  - ""SA2s are comparable to the units used in other neighbourhood level DSCM studies (e.g., Clare et al. 2009;Townsley et al. 2015).""

The choice of SA2 is justified by several factors:

1. **Theoretical Relevance**: The SA2 units are considered appropriate for capturing the concept of 'activity space' as they approximate neighborhoods, which are relevant for understanding crime patterns in relation to offenders' activity locations.

2. **Comparability with Previous Studies**: The use of SA2 is consistent with other neighborhood-level discrete spatial choice modeling (DSCM) studies, ensuring that the results can be compared with existing literature.

3. **Balance of Considerations**: The selection of SA2 balances theoretical relevance, spatial spill-over, spatial heterogeneity, and computational processing. This means that the size of SA2 is neither too small to be overly influenced by surrounding areas nor too large to miss important variations within the unit.

4. **Practical Constraints**: The choice also considers computational limitations, as using too many units could exceed the capacity of available computing equipment.

These points collectively provide a comprehensive rationale for the choice of SA2 as the SUoA, highlighting both theoretical and practical considerations."

Rationale Summary: The census tract was chosen due to its use in previous studies, availability of collective efficacy data, and computational feasibility.","  - ""In line with many other studies of spatial choice (Block and Block, 1995;Boggs, 1965;Velez, 2001), we use the census tract as our unit of analysis of location choice.""
  - ""Although smaller units of analysis minimize within-unit heterogeneity, the census tract was chosen as the spatial unit of analysis because it was the lowest level of aggregation for which the ""collective efficacy"" measure was available and because computationally the use of the resource-intensive discrete choice model with smaller spatial units of analysis would have required a drastic reduction in sample size.""
  - ""Furthermore, our reading of the empirical literature that addresses the modifiable area unit problem in the context of crime (e.g., Hipp, 2007; Wooldredge, 2002) is that effects tend to be fairly robust across geographic levels of aggregation.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the census tract was chosen as the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) for several reasons. First, it follows previous studies in the field, indicating a methodological consistency.
- The availability of the ""collective efficacy"" measure at the census tract level was a significant factor in choosing this SUoA. This suggests that data availability was a crucial consideration.
- The computational constraints associated with using smaller spatial units also influenced the decision. This indicates a practical constraint related to the feasibility of the analysis.
- The authors mention that effects are robust across different geographic levels of aggregation, which supports the choice of census tracts as a suitable scale for analysis."

SUoA: Neighborhoods in The Hague
Rationale: Not specified (inferred from focus on neighborhood-level analysis)","  - ""The study of the effects of neighborhood features reflecting attractiveness and opportunity has a long-standing tradition in criminology.""
  - ""The hypotheses are tested using data on the city of The Hague, the Netherlands.""
  - ""We used data on 89 neighborhoods, as 5 neighborhoods are almost or completely non-residential (industrial areas, parks, dune area).""
  - ""the average neighborhood has a surface of 0.65 square kilometers, is the home to 4950, residents and contains 2350 residential units.""
  - ""The measure of ethnic heterogeneity was constructed from data on the ethnic composition of neighborhoods.""
  - ""Residential mobility was calculated as the sum of the relative annual number of residents who moved out of the neighborhood and the relative annual number who moved into the neighborhood.""
  - ""The average real estate value of residential units was based on the real estate tax administration of the municipality of The Hague.""
  - ""Home ownership was also established using the real estate tax registration.""
  - ""Proximity to the central business district of The Hague was defined in terms of a concentric zone model.""
  - ""The Moran's I statistic, measuring residual spatial autocorrelation, is highly significant, signaling that burglary rates tend to cluster spatially after the effect of SWEBER is controlled for.""
  - ""Notwithstanding these caveats, our study shows that the use of spatially weighted measures of accessibility to offenders offers a new and promising approach to research on intra-urban spatial dynamics of crime.""",,"- The paper focuses on assessing the effects of attractiveness, opportunity, and accessibility on residential burglary rates in urban neighborhoods, specifically in The Hague, Netherlands.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is neighborhoods within The Hague, chosen because the study aims to understand neighborhood-level factors influencing burglary rates.
- The study uses data from 89 neighborhoods, excluding non-residential areas, indicating a focus on residential environments.
- Variables include ethnic heterogeneity, residential mobility, real estate value, home ownership, and proximity to the central business district (CBD), all measured at the neighborhood level.
- The rationale for using neighborhoods as the SUoA is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the focus on neighborhood characteristics and their influence on burglary rates.
- The study employs a spatially weighted measure (SWEBER) to assess accessibility, highlighting the importance of spatial dynamics in understanding crime patterns."

  - ""As a compromise, we decided to use the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) geography as the basic spatial unit of analysis. LSOAs are defined on the basis of proximity and social homogeneity measures (type of dwelling and nature of tenure) and have a population of approximately 1,500 residents and 600 households.""",,"1. The paper uses the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) as the spatial unit of analysis. This choice is justified by the need for more homogeneous spatial units and enhanced ecological validity, as LSOAs have a smaller average population compared to other units used in previous studies, such as those by Lammers et al. (2015).

2. The rationale for choosing LSOAs is based on their definition by proximity and social homogeneity measures, which are important for analyzing crime location choices. This aligns with the theory-method category, as it is chosen to capture neighborhood effects and ensure the analysis is representative of the social and spatial dynamics relevant to burglary location choices.

3. The study also considers spillover effects using hierarchical spatial nesting structures, which further supports the choice of LSOAs due to their design to optimize social homogeneity.

4. The paper explicitly states that the choice of LSOAs was a compromise to balance the need for small spatial units with the complexity of using even smaller units, indicating a practical constraint consideration.

5. The study's focus on repeat crime location choices and the use of a smaller spatial unit of analysis compared to previous studies is a key methodological decision that influences the study's design and findings."

REASONING:

- The paper uses a discrete spatial choice approach, which involves analyzing geographical spatial units where offenders may choose to commit crimes. This indicates that the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is crucial for understanding offender behavior.
- The study regions were selected based on equivalence in size of the known burglar population, number of targets, and total number of areas, which suggests a methodological rationale for choosing these specific spatial units.
- The variables used in the study are operationalized to capture different constructs relevant to burglary, such as target availability, target accessibility, community stability, proximity, and affluence. These variables are essential for understanding the factors influencing burglar target selection.
- The choice of spatial units (neighborhoods, Super Output Areas, Statistical Local Areas) is based on data availability and methodological considerations, as these units provide the necessary granularity to capture the constructs being studied."

  - ""Distance is highlighted as an important factor in target selection, which is consistent with previous studies of terrorist activity""
  - ""The results illustrate the impact of distance decay, with perpetrators less likely to select an area as distance from the home increases, most likely due to the changes in required effort.""
  - ""The identifiable effects of the distance variables could be extremely beneficial for investigative techniques, especially when a threat is made against a specific target""
  - ""Something that could be taken into consideration in future analyses is the mode of transport to and from each attack.""
  - ""Travelling on foot yields higher risk than by car and it is likely that the perpetrators would stay closer to home.""
  - ""Travelling to more distant areas on foot would also be much more time consuming, and could increase the risk of identification and apprehension""
  - ""Contrary to expectations, an association between target selection and distance from the city centre was not supported.""

  - ""The main reason for this was because they could not be directly attributed to a specific individual.""
  - ""Also, due to the underlying mechanisms of this model, the data had to be restricted to one city.""
  - ""It was also necessary to omit attacks in Belfast committed by non-residents and incidents outside of Belfast committed by Belfast residents from the sample, thus the effects of the distance variables may be underestimated.""
  - ""This dataset is a slightly smaller sample in comparison to most previous similar studies of crime.""
  - ""There may be some parameter inflation and there is the possibility of skewing of distributions to values higher than the true odds ratio.""
  - ""Although the sample used in this study was deemed sufficient for the implementation of the model (Greenland et al., 2000), utilisation of a larger sample size would have been preferable.""
  - ""As well as improving the power and reliability of the model, a larger dataset would have enabled further hypothesis testing.""
  - ""Areal unit boundaries are arbitrary and lack ecological meaning (Bursik, 1986) and the characteristic data used may not be an accurate representation of the perceptions of those living in the areas (Coulton et al., 2001).""
  - ""Smaller units would enable factors such as the effects of social disorganisation to be touched upon, if the data was available.""
  - ""The theoretical notions apply to much smaller units and the street block is the most appropriate unit for analysis (Taylor, 1997).""
  - ""However, larger areal units such as small areas relax the effects of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) which is a consideration of the conditional logit estimation.""
  - ""As well as the necessity of replicating this study using other cities in Northern Ireland where PIRA were in operation, further studies should examine different terrorist groups to identify how transferable the effects are to different contexts.""
  - ""A good comparison would be another organisation with similar targeting patterns, for example Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA).""
  - ""Groups with different ideologies should also be studied, to increase the model's generalisability.""
  - ""There are several ways this study could be improved and expanded on through the further disaggregation of data.""
  - ""Initially, we aimed to distinguish between different types of targets (i.e.

attacks on premises and attacks on individuals), as different types of crimes tend to exhibit different spatial patterns (Andresen and Linning, 2012).""
  - ""However, there was insufficient data to do so.""
  - ""Differences between males and females could be examined as well as modes of attack (bombings, shootings, arson etc.) and types of human target, i.e. military/government/civilian.""
  - ""Other models, such as a mixed logit (McFadden and Train, 2000) or latent class model, could be considered in future studies.""
  - ""The mixed logit also accounts for idiosyncratic variations as it is likely that individuals place different emphases on certain attributes, for example distance (Robinson 1950).""
  - ""Disparities in the attacks of different terrorists could be looked at, in particular for PIRA where there were variations in the skill sets of members.""
  - ""Gill et al. (2017) found differences between different roles in the group (in this case shooters and IED planters),

i.e. IED planters travelled longer distances to attacks.""
  - ""The use of a mixed logit or latent class model would also relax the effects of IIA.""
  - ""Temporal variations are often neglected in criminological research (Ratcliffe, 2006).""
  - ""Using a model of spatiotemporal choice as opposed to spatial choice may demonstrate that certain types of attacks were more likely to occur on certain days of the week, or certain times of day (included in the set of alternatives), and improve the understanding of target selection.""
  - ""For example, PIRA tended to avoid attacks on Saturdays as fewer people would hear about it on the news on a Sunday, and attacks were often tailored to fit in with the working and social schedules of members (Collins, 1998).""
  - ""Terrorism is not static (Drake, 1998), and PIRA's structure and strategy underwent many changes throughout their campaign (Asal et al., 2013; Gill and Horgan, 2013).""
  - ""Future research could incorporate distinctions between the different phases of PIRA activity, to see if changes in strategy were reflected in variations in target patterning.""
  - ""It may also be interesting to examine differences between different groups in the same conflict.""

3. **SUoA**: The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) used in this study is the ""Small Areas"" (SAs) in Belfast, Northern Ireland. These areas are designed for statistical purposes and follow physical features like roads and rivers.
4. **Methods**: The study uses a discrete choice model to understand target selection by terrorists. The model considers multiple factors such as distance, natural barriers, and ideology.
5. **Variables**: The independent variables include distance from the home to the attack site, presence of major roads, police stations, and military bases.
6. **Variable Counts**: The study includes several variables categorized under demographic, economic, crime attractors, distance/accessibility, temporal/control, and other.
7. **Key Findings**: The study finds that distance from home decreases the likelihood of an area being chosen, while the presence of major roads and military/police stations increases this likelihood.
8. **Data Quality**: The study notes limitations such as historical data constraints, lack of sociodemographic variables, and potential biases in data representation.
9. **Data Limitations**: The study acknowledges limitations in data availability, particularly for sociodemographic factors and the retrospective nature of the data."

Go where the money is: modeling street robbers' location choices,"Wim Bernasco, Richard Block, Stijn Ruiter",-,-,-,-,-,"- SUoA: Census blocks

  - ""In 2000 there were 24,594 census blocks in Chicago from which a robber chooses a single one when committing a robbery.""
  - ""In Chicago, with an average surface of 140 m Â 140 m (460 ftÂ 460 ft) and an average population of 118 residents, census blocks are approximately 30 times smaller than census tracts.""
  - ""Zooming in to block level allows us to analyze in a detailed way the location choices of robbers.""",,"The paper by Wim Bernasco, Richard Block, and Stijn Ruiter focuses on the spatial decision-making of street robbers in Chicago. The study uses census blocks as the spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) to capture the fine-grained spatial decisions of street robbers. The choice of census blocks is justified by their small size, which allows for a detailed analysis of robbery location choices. The authors argue that using smaller spatial units like census blocks helps minimize aggregation bias and provides a more precise understanding of the spatial dynamics involved in street robberies.

The paper identifies several independent variables that influence the location choices of street robbers, including the presence of legal and illegal cash economies, accessibility features like main streets and public transport hubs, and the racial and ethnic composition of the population. The study also considers the distance from the offender's home as a critical factor in location choice.

The SUoA rationale is based on the need for detailed spatial analysis, which is facilitated by the small size of census blocks compared to larger units like census tracts. This choice is consistent with recent research trends that emphasize the importance of analyzing crime at smaller spatial scales to capture localized patterns and effects."

  - ""The results of this study showed that the past crime data have a significant impact on the choice of location for crimes made by later offenders.""
  - ""the study is significant because it indicated that past crime data are effective for indexing the attractiveness of neighbourhoods for residential burglars.""",,"- The study uses a discrete choice model to analyze the crime location choice process of residential burglars, focusing on the attractiveness of neighborhoods.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is 500 m grid cells in Sendai City, Japan. This choice allows for unbiased comparison due to the equal size of grid cells.
- The rationale for using grid cells includes data availability and the need to avoid areas affected by the 2011 tsunami, which could have altered the environment.
- The study examines several independent variables: distance from the offender's residence, number of residential units, proportion of single-family dwellings, number of past residential burglaries, past residential burglary rate, proportion of foreigners, and proportion of newcomers.

2. **Context**: The study is set in The Hague and its suburbs, with a focus on adolescents aged 12-16. The data sources include self-reported questionnaires, space-time budget interviews, and police records.

3. **SUoA (Spatial Unit of Analysis)**: The spatial unit of analysis is not explicitly defined in terms of a specific geographic unit like grid cells or postal codes. However, the study uses detailed geographic tracks of offenders and their activity spaces, which are reconstructed from space-time budget interviews and police records. The rationale for the spatial unit is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be driven by the need to capture detailed mobility patterns and crime locations.

4. **Methods**: The study uses a discrete spatial choice approach to analyze the data, with a focus on predicting crime locations based on offenders' activity spaces and prior crime locations.

5. **Variables**: The study examines variables related to offenders' mobility patterns, such as the number of unique locations visited, radius of gyration, and predictability of whereabouts. It also considers crime locations, prior offenses, and points of interest as potential crime attractors.

6. **Data Limitations**: The study acknowledges limitations related to the short observation period of four days for mobility data and the potential underestimation of visited locations. It also notes the incomplete nature of police data due to unreported crimes and low clearance rates."

- The study area is described as the entire province of East Flanders, which is a densely urbanized area with a large population. This context suggests that the choice of the house as the SUoA is due to its relevance to the study area's characteristics.
- The paper highlights the advantage of using fine-grained spatial units like houses to address the modifiable areal unit problem and reduce aggregation bias. This is a theoretical-methodological justification for the SUoA choice.
- The preference for micro-places like houses is emphasized because they more accurately measure the environment in which offenders act. This is another theoretical-methodological rationale for choosing the house as the SUoA.
- The paper's focus on the house as the ultimate outcome of burglary target selection further supports the choice of the house as the SUoA."

## DATA LIMITATIONS EXTRACTION  
Data Limitations:  
Quote 1: ""To make the assumption of consistent preferences reasonable, only residential breaking and entering crimes occurring in the third quarter of the year were used.""  
Category: Temporal limitations  
Summary: Limited to third quarter of 1997 for consistent preferences.  

Quote 2: ""The presence of such features creates a possibility of extreme multicollinearity if care is not taken in feature selection.""  
Category: Methodological  
Summary: Potential multicollinearity issue with feature selection.

Quote 3: ""The large number of candidate predictors prevents description of each in this article.""  
Category: Data quality  
Summary: Limited description of all candidate predictors due to their large number.

Overall Limitation Summary: The study is limited by its focus on a specific time period and potential multicollinearity issues with feature selection.","  - ""The dataset of breaking and entering crime analyzed here was obtained from the Richmond City Records Management Center and augmented with publicly available GIS layers to introduce proximity measurements and census information.""
  - ""The complete dataset consists of all reported breaking and entering crime in the City of Richmond, VA for calendar year 1997.""
  - ""To make the assumption of consistent preferences reasonable, only residential breaking and entering crimes occurring in the third quarter of the year were used.""
  - ""The choice set was defined using the following steps. The smallest rectangle that would wholly circumscribe the boundaries of the City of Richmond was the extents of a grid with 100 rows and 100 columns.""
  - ""The candidate predictor set, F, consists of proximity measurements to each of 30 features in the geographic space and 38 demographic profile variables aggregated at the census block group level.""
  - ""The feature selection process (illustrated in Fig. 2 ) resulted in 11 predictors being used, a much larger set than the standard multinomial logit model.""
  - ""The coefficient on u 30 , a proximity measure, is negative, indicating the feature it represents is attractive.""
  - ""u 66 is a density measurement, and the coefficient indicates positive association with selection likelihood.""",,"- The study uses a dataset from the Richmond City Records Management Center, which provides information on breaking and entering crimes in Richmond, VA, for the year 1997.
- The dataset is limited to residential breaking and entering crimes in the third quarter of 1997 to ensure consistent preferences.
- The spatial unit of analysis is a grid with 100 rows and 100 columns that covers the City of Richmond, indicating a spatial unit size.
- The study uses proximity measurements to 30 features and 38 demographic variables aggregated at the census block group level, which are part of the independent variables.
- The feature selection process resulted in 11 predictors being used, which are part of the independent variables.
- The study includes proximity measures and density measurements as independent variables."
Residential burglary target selection: An analysis at the property-level using Google Street View,"Samuel H Langton, Wouter Steenbeek",-,-,,40,2017,"- Independent Variables: Ease of escape, Accessibility, Surveillability
- SUoA Rationale: Not specified
- SUoA Type: Individual residential properties
- SUoA Size: Not specified
- SUoA #Units: Not specified
- SUoA Pop./Unit: Not specified
- Data Limitations: Inability to capture isolated properties, potential biases in the sample","  - ""The ease of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are all positively related to burglary risk.""
  - ""One would expect that burglars place less importance on attributes relating to surveillability during hours of darkness.""
  - ""There is no evidence to suggest that indications of resident wealth have an effect on target selection.""
  - ""The data collection technique is not without its drawbacks. The inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a bias sample, as these cannot be coded.""
  - ""There is no evidence that indications of resident wealth are related to the likelihood of victimisation, or that the effect of surveillability varies depending on the extent of collective efficacy in a neighbourhood.""
  - ""The results indicate that the more residential units are considered to be under surveillance, the less likely they are to be burglarised. Conversely, properties that are more accessible and are easier to escape from are more likely to be targeted by burglars.""
  - ""The findings lead us to reject the null hypotheses of no effect for hypotheses H1, H2 and H4. For H3, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between indications of resident wealth and the risk of being burgled.""",,"- The paper identifies several key factors that influence burglary risk: ease of escape, accessibility, and surveillability. These are the independent variables used in the study.
- The study finds that surveillability, accessibility, and ease of escape are significant predictors of burglary risk, while indications of resident wealth are not.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is not explicitly justified in the provided text, but it is implied that the study uses individual residential properties as the unit of analysis.
- The study uses a case-control design to isolate property-level effects from neighborhood-level effects, which is a methodological choice.
- The paper discusses limitations related to data quality and spatial limitations, such as the inability to capture isolated properties and potential biases in the sample."
