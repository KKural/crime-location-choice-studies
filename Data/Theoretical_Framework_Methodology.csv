  - ""No offender appears in the data more than once.""
  - ""Of the available data (N = 3,914), 2,299 records contained entries for both the residential and the offense location. Only these data were used in the analysis,""

- **Variable Construction:** Key variables such as distance between residence and offense location were calculated using Euclidean distance between LSOA centroids. Other variables like population churn rates, ethnic heterogeneity, and deprivation were derived from census data and other official sources.
- **Missing Data Handling:** The paper mentions that only records with complete information for both residential and offense locations were used, indicating that incomplete records were excluded from the analysis.
- **Data Integration:** The study integrated data from the Metropolitan Police Service with data from the U.K. Census and other government sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
- **Quality Control:** The use of official data sources like the U.K. Census and the Metropolitan Police Service suggests a level of quality control in terms of data reliability and accuracy.","  - ""The estimates of population churn rates and ethnic heterogeneity were derived using data from the 2001 U.K. Census.""

  - ""The results also provide some support for theories of social disorganization as influencing the spatial decision making of rioters.""",,"- The paper discusses several demographic and social variables relevant to the study.
- Population churn rates and ethnic heterogeneity are explicitly mentioned as variables derived from the 2001 U.K. Census, which are demographic and social structure variables.
- The number of schools is a social structure variable related to education.
- The age distribution of offenders is a demographic variable, as it describes the age structure of the population involved in the riots.
- The effect of propinquity (distance from home) is related to social processes, as it influences spatial decision making.
- The mention of social disorganization theories suggests that social cohesion and collective efficacy are considered, although not explicitly quantified in the provided quotes.
- The contagion variable, while not strictly demographic or social, is related to social processes as it involves the influence of recent events on behavior.","  - ""To measure deprivation, we use the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010 obtained from the U.K. Department for Communities and Local Government (McLennan et al., 2011).""
  - ""the odds of an area being selected increases by a factor of between 1.27 and 1.63 for every 10 unit increase in the index of deprivation.""
  - ""All other things being equal, areas with higher estimated levels of deprivation (hypothesis 10) were more likely to be selected on each day of the riots.""",,"- The paper mentions the use of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010 as a measure of deprivation. This is a clear economic variable related to economic status and prosperity.
- The IMD is used to assess the economic deprivation of areas, which is a key economic status measure.
- The paper discusses how areas with higher deprivation levels were more likely to be targeted during the riots, indicating that economic status was a factor in target choice.
- The IMD is a widely recognized economic deprivation index, making it a relevant economic variable in this context."

  - ""We argue that Fig. 2 only tells half of the story. Building on previous geography of crime research, the aim of this article is twofold. First, expanding upon previous theoretical arguments made by others (see e.g., Curtis-Ham et al. 2020;Johnson et al. 2007;Van Sleeuwen et al. 2018), we argue how crime pattern theory needs to be extended to better understand both where and when crimes are committed.""

- The literature gap addressed by this study is the lack of temporal specificity in crime pattern theory. The study aims to extend this theory to include time-varying applicability of spatial knowledge.

REASONING:

- **Data Cleaning:** The paper mentions that the data used had complete information on the variables of interest, implying that incomplete data was excluded.

  - ""Prior to analysis, these data needed preprocessing. For example, graph theory metrics are susceptible to edge effects because their derivation (discussed later in this article) involves the modeling of movement throughout the wider street network.""
  - ""To avoid this, we used a temporary 7-km buffer in the calculations. Features that can distort the calculation of the metrics were also cleaned. For example, divided features such as motorways were collapsed to a single edge to reflect the lived reality of such roads, and traffic islands were collapsed to a single edge""
  - ""The cleaned networks were then converted into a form suitable for graph theory analyses (discussed later in this article). For example, split links, which can occur when streets have different names at either end but have no junction in between, were merged.""

  - ""Conversely, it is also likely that more affluent dwellings will have better security measures and are therefore likely to be more difficult to break into.""
  - ""Offense location choices are also likely influenced by the type of targets available.

Possible factors include law enforcement activity (e.g. patrol intensity and investigative efficiency of the police that influence the risk of arrest), victim vigilance (e.g. hired private security personnel around businesses) and criminal competition (e.g. gangs violently dominating the local area). Our data did not contain appropriate localized measures of factors that could potentially deter robbers and force them to choose alternative robbery locations.""",,"- The study uses the ""discrete choice framework"" as its theoretical foundation, which is an economic approach to understanding decision-making processes.
