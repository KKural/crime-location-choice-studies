  - ""the indices used to estimate neighborhood levels of ethnic diversity and rates of population churn were based on data from the 2001 U.K. Census.

  - ""Unfortunately, data regarding police activity were unavailable for analysis, and so we could not estimate the effect of police officer presence, or the number of arrests made in an area during the riots, on offender spatial decision making.""
  - ""The results presented are robust to the inclusion of two other variables: a measure of police strength and a measure of police relations in the destination areas.

The parameter estimates for these variables are not included in this article as they were measured at a level of geographic resolution that was much larger than the LSOAs.""
  - ""the estimates of ethnic diversity and the IMD were divided by ten.""",,"- **Data Quality Issues:** The paper mentions that the indices used for estimating neighborhood levels of ethnic diversity and population churn were based on 2001 census data, which may not accurately reflect current demographics due to changes over time.

- **Temporal Limitations:** The study relies on data from a specific time period (August 6-11, 2011), which may not be representative of other time periods or events.
- **Geographic Limitations:** The study focuses on Greater London, which may not be representative of other geographic areas.
- **Model Limitations:** The discrete choice model assumes that offenders make independent choices based on utility maximization, which may not fully capture complex social dynamics.

The use of crime pattern theory suggests some generalizability to urban crimes, but this is not explicitly tested across different contexts.
- **Comparative Limitations:** The study does not compare its findings across different riots or contexts, limiting the ability to generalize across different scenarios.

  - ""The results also provide some support for theories of social disorganization as influencing the spatial decision making of rioters.""
  - ""The aim of the current article was to advance understanding of the spatial decision making of rioters and to consider the utility of different theoretical accounts.""

The first applies to spatial scale. While classic studies on the geography of crime (Shaw and McKay, 1942;Sampson et al., 1997) have used large urban areas as their spatial units of analysis, recent research suggests that often crime concentrations are not larger than a street segment (Smith et al., 2000;Weisburd et al., 2004) or street corner (McCord and Ratcliffe, 2007). To improve our understanding of the fine-grained spatial decisions of street robbers, we zoom in to the level of census blocks.""
  - ""We use data that are disaggregated to the level of census blocks. In Chicago, with an average surface of 140 m Â 140 m (460 ftÂ 460 ft) and an average population of 118 residents, census blocks are approximately 30 times smaller than census tracts.""
  - ""When performing the analysis on units as small as census blocks, spatial spillover effects are plausible (Bernasco, 2010). For example, a retail store that attracts robbers will not only pull robbers to the block where it is located, but also to adjacent blocks that are just across the street and around the corner.""
  - ""The hypothesis is not self-evident, however, because the opposite phenomenon, spatial competition, is plausible as well. Spatial competition implies that the presence of robbery attractors in adjacent blocks pulls away robbers from the focal block and thus has a negative effect in the probability of robbery in the focal block.""
  - ""The existence of this 'spatial agglomeration effect' (Fotheringham, 1988) was expected because street robbers must attack close to the businesses that their potential victims are heading to or returning from, as otherwise the victims will have entered their homes, vehicles, public transport or other facilities.""
  - ""the universal logit model was extended with the 15 same attributes of second-order spatially adjacent blocks (because of computer memory limitations we used a sample of 4000 instead of 6000 alternatives for this analysis). With one single exception, the estimates (presented in Supplementary Table S4 of the Supplementary Appendix) were nonsignificant.""
  - ""the estimates of the spatially lagged adjacent block variables indicate that robbery attraction spills over to adjacent blocks. The effects of the 'spatially lagged' variables, listed in the bottom part of Table 4 under the 'Adjacent blocks' heading, are positive like those of the regular variables, indicating that the same factors that make robbers select a particular block also make them select adjacent blocks.""",,"- The paper discusses the use of census blocks as the spatial unit of analysis, which is a finer scale compared to larger urban areas or census tracts.
