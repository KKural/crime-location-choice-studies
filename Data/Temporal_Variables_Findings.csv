This suggests that the physical environment and crime attractors are relevant.
- The mention of ""home occupancy in residential neighbourhoods"" and ""the number of cars parked on a parking lot"" as time-varying features indicates that these are environmental variables affecting crime attractiveness.
- The presence of ""locks and escape routes"" as time-stable features suggests these are part of the built environment.
- The paper highlights that offenders acquire knowledge about their spatial environment through daily routines, which includes physical and built environment features.
- The survey's focus on routine activities in different domains (residences, schools, jobs, etc.) implies that these are behavioral patterns and crime attractors.
- The use of ""neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes"" as a variable suggests that land use and built environment are considered.","  - ""The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second-and third-order neighbourhoods.""

  - ""If we include first-order spatial lags (i.e., neighbourhoods adjacent to those with the activity nodes), second-order spatial lags, and even thirdorder spatial lags, the median area of the neighbourhoods increased to 3.37 km 2 , 14.5 km 2 , and 55.6 km 2 , respectively.""

- The mention of ""first-, second-, and third-order neighbourhoods"" indicates a measure of spatial proximity or accessibility, as it describes the distance or adjacency of neighbourhoods to activity nodes.
- The use of ""spatial lags"" refers to the inclusion of adjacent neighbourhoods, which is a measure of spatial accessibility or proximity.
- The geocoding of locations to specific neighbourhoods suggests a focus on spatial relationships and accessibility within these defined areas.

- The replacement of distances of zero with an average distance between random points in a postal code is a methodological detail related to distance measurement.
- The use of four-digit postal code areas as spatial units of analysis implies a focus on spatial relationships and accessibility within these defined areas.
