- The number of units is clearly stated as 4,765 LSOAs in the Greater London area.
- The rationale for choosing LSOAs is implied by the mention of data availability and the advantage of smaller units in representing population characteristics.
- The quoted rationale suggests that the choice was based on data availability and the practical advantage of using smaller units for more representative data.
- The justification summary is that LSOAs were chosen due to their availability in the UK census data and their suitability for representing detailed population characteristics.",NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,exact_normalized
