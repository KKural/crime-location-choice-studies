KEY FINDINGS:
Main Results: Rioters targeted areas close to their home locations and those with routine activity nodes like schools and transport hubs. They were less likely to cross the Thames River. Contagion was a significant factor, with rioters more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours.
Significant Predictors: Distance from home, presence of schools, presence of underground stations, retail floor space, previous 24 hours
Model Performance: Pseudo R² = 0.34 (average across days)
Scale Effects: Not explicitly mentioned

DATA QUALITY NOTES:
Variable Information Quality: Complete
Missing Information: None explicitly mentioned
Extraction Confidence: High","  - ""Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind.""
  - ""To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police.""
  - ""The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular.""
  - ""rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River.""
  - ""In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours.""
  - ""The police data consist of all offenses that were detected, and that were identified as having been associated with the riots, by the Metropolitan police for the period August 6-11, 2011.""
  - ""Each record contained an identifier of the area within which the offense took place, the area in which the offender was recorded as living, the date and time at which the offense was estimated to have occurred, and the age of the offender.""
  - ""The results suggest an unequivocal effect of propinquity (hypothesis 1) on offender spatial decision making, with offenders (young or old) being more likely to target areas that were closer to their area of residence.""
  - ""Considering potential (collective) routine activity nodes, all other things being equal, the odds of an offender selecting an area increases by a factor of between 1.29 and 2.09 for every additional school that is located within it (hypothesis 3).""

Residential areas in which the offender lived at the time of the offense were indicated, divided into two separate variables to indicate areas in which the offender had lived for a shorter period (since <2 years) at the time of the offense or for a longer period (since >2 years).""
  - ""Specific target area characteristics were included as control variables in our study because they are described as indicators of crime attractors and crime generators (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1995) or of guardianship (Cohen and Felson, 1979), and several studies have found that they influenced crime rates in an area (Bernasco and Block, 2011;Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;McCord et al., 2007;Nieuwbeerta et al., 2008;Reynald, 2011).""
  - ""Discrete choice models are used to explain why an individual chooses a specific single alternative when presented with a distinct number of alternatives (Ben-Akiva and Bierlaire, 2003), given attributes of the alternatives and attributes of the individual.""
  - ""The dependent variable in this study is a choice of an area j from a geographical set of alternatives J to commit a crime in.""
  - ""The pseudo R-squared of this full model was .35, which again shows that a large part of the variation in crime location choice can be explained by prior crime locations, former and current residential locations, and the area characteristics included in the model.""
  - ""The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices.""
  - ""The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime.""
  - ""The offender's residential area has been found to influence crime location choice (e.g., Baudains, Braithwaite, and Johnson, 2013;Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005; Johnson and Summers, 2014; Townsley et al., 2014), and so do former areas of residence (Bernasco, 2010b)""",,

Familiar Locations and Similar Activities: Examining the Contributions of Reliable and Relevant Knowledge in Offenders' Crime Location Choices,"Sophie Curtis-Ham, Wim Bernasco, Oleg N Medvedev, Devon L L Polaschek",-,-,-,-,-,"The study uses data from the New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application (NIA) covering offenses from 2009 to 2018, including various pre-offense activity locations and demographic details of offenders. It analyzes crime location choices using discrete choice models across multiple crime types in New Zealand.","  - ""Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders' pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members' home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand.""
  - ""Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge-where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities-and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities.""
  - ""The study illustrates both the opportunities and challenges involved in employing this methodological paradigm with police administrative data.""
  - ""Offense and activity node data were sourced from the New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application (NIA).""
  - ""The dataset and data cleaning steps have been described extensively in other studies (Curtis-Ham et al., 2021a , 2022b).""
  - ""Initially, we collected all burglary, robbery, and extrafamilial sex offenses committed between 2009 and 2018 where an offender had been identified with sufficient evidence to prosecute.""
  - ""The legal definitions and operational classifications of these crimes, and their rates per population, are comparable with other Western democracies (https:// dataunodc.un.org/).""
  - ""These data included the location (address and geographic coordinates), date, and time at which the offense occurred; other offense attributes indicating the type of location and type of crime; and demographic details of the offender.""
  - ""The theoretical model we tested is universal to all crime, so we analyzed a range of crime types varying in target (premises versus people) and motivation (acquiring property versus sexual violence).""
  - ""The offenders were mostly male (ranging from 80% male for personal robbery to 97% for sex offenses) with a median age of 18-21 for the property offenses and 28 for sex offenses.""
  - ""Pre-offense activity locations were also sourced from NIA and included the locations of: offenders' and their family members' home addresses (about 15% and 46% of activity locations, respectively); school and other educational institutions attended by the offenders (1%); their workplaces (<1%); previous offenses they committed (15%); offenses they were involved in as a victim or witness (4%); non-crime incidents in which they were involved (4%); and miscellaneous encounters with or sightings by police labeled, for example, as ""spoken to at,"" ""seen at,"" ""frequents,"" or ""arrested at"" (14%).""
  - ""Activity locations could date back to the offender's date of birth, except for prior offenses/ incidents which dated from 2004 (due to limited transfer of these records when NIA was created).""
  - ""The outcome variable reflects each offender's choice of crime location: in which of the 2,153 SA2s the reference offense was committed.""
  - ""The general pattern of results-supporting H1(a) to (c)-was that offenders were more likely to commit crime near to activity nodes that were high on both reliability and relevance, lower in proximity to activity nodes that were high on only reliability or relevance and lowest in proximity to activity nodes that were low on both reliability and relevance.""
  - ""The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.""
  - ""the findings demonstrate the salience of a broad range of activity locations to offenders' crime location choices.""
  - ""The present findings build on prior studies that employed DSCMs to study individual reliability and relevance variables in isolation (e.g., Bernasco, 2019;Ruiter, 2017;van Sleeuwen et al., 2021), by demonstrating how these variables operate collectively.""
  - ""The pattern of declining likelihood of crime with increasing distance-clearest for the high reliability/high relevance activity locations-is also consistent with previous studies (Bernasco, 2019;Bernasco & Block, 2009;Kuralarasan & Bernasco, 2021;Menting et al., 2020).""

- The study covers a range of crime types including residential burglaries, non-residential burglaries, commercial robberies, personal robberies, and extra-familial sex offenses.

DATA QUALITY NOTES
Variable Information Quality: Complete
Missing Information: None
Extraction Confidence: High","  - ""The present study explicitly considers the impact of meso-level social context on burglars' choice of target neighborhoods.""
  - ""We measure observed and perceived physical disorder from 107,858 street view images using computer vision algorithms.""
  - ""Geo-referenced mobile phone flows between 1,642 census units are used to approximate offenders' potential spatial knowledge about target neighborhoods.""
  - ""Discrete choice models are estimated separately for burglars from disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged neighborhoods (N=1,972).""
  - ""We highlight the importance of larger neighborhood structural characteristics and their interactions with spatial knowledge and environmental conditions such as visual signs of disorder, in criminal decision making.""
  - ""Physical disorder is not uniformly indicative of decay across neighborhoods and offenders.""
  - ""spatial knowledge is most effective in triggering or deterring actions in places that are categorically different from offenders' residential spaces.""
  - ""The present study focuses on the city of ZG in southeast China.""
  - ""We use communities (juweihui or cunweihui) as the unit of analysis.""
  - ""The police arrest data record the actual burglary cases between 2017 and 2018 in the city of ZG.""
  - ""To measure the spatial knowledge between neighborhoods, we obtain mobility flows from mobile phone usage for the whole month of October 2019 from China Unicom Inc, a major telecom provider in China.""
  - ""We construct neighborhood concentrated disadvantage based on the following seven neighborhood conditions: unemployment rate, low educational attainment (high school or lower), share of non-locals, overcrowding, share of renters, average rent price, and access to tap water, bath, and kitchen.""
  - ""We model burglars' target location choice using a conditional logit specification where a burglar's decision of where to offend depends on an array of factors involving the characteristics of both the residential and potential target neighborhoods.""
  - ""The likelihood of a community being targeted for burglary reduces as its distance from burglar's home increases, more so for Non-Dis-residing burglars (reduces by a factor of 0.325 and 0.326, p<0.001) than Dis-residing burglars (OR ranges between 0.299 and 0.300, p<0.001).""
  - ""More populated destination communities are also more likely to be targeted, with one unit increase in the population logarithm leading to 98.6%-100.9% higher odds for Non-Dis-residing burglars (p<0.001) and 78.7%-82.2% higher odds for Dis-residing burglars (p<0.001).""
  - ""The presence of post-2000 newer buildings strongly predicts burglary risk for both groups of burglars with OR over 2.4 (p<0.001).""
  - ""Burglars from nondisadvantaged communities also strongly dislike communities with a higher proportion of tall buildings but to a lesser extent (reduces by a factor of 0.361-0.365, p<0.001).""
  - ""Transportation facilitations function as crime generators with one more subway station increasing the risk of being targeted by 20% among Non-Dis burglars (p<0.05) and over 80%

among Dis burglars (p<0.001).""
  - ""Bus stops also significantly increases burglary risk by 1.2% and 1.6% among Non-Dis and Dis burglars, respectively, for each additional bus stop (p<0.001).""
  - ""Parks are related to a marginally elevated risk of burglary only for Dis-residing burglars (OR=0.05).""
  - ""Entertainment venues-karaoke bars, Internet cafes, bars, and cinemas-positively predict burglary among Non-Dis-residing burglars only, with each additional venue bringing about 4% higher odds (p<0.001) to the local area.""","  - ""(Page 43, Table 1) | Residential Context                                      | Observed Physical Disorder |                      | Perceived Disorder     |                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                          | M1                         | M2                   | M3                     | M4                   |""

  - ""We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection.""
  - ""Conclusions Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars' target choices.""
  - ""The remainder of this article is structured as follows. The next section reviews prior empirical research on burglars' spatial decision-making.""
  - ""The major contribution of our research is that it investigates burglary target choice at the appropriate level of aggregation-burglars burglarize homes rather than complete neighborhoods-while still considering neighborhood-level attributes that affect these choices and taking into account the home locations of the burglars themselves and their limited action radius.""
  - ""To assess the role of the offenders' home locations and the locations of any previous burglaries they committed, the analysis must include only cleared burglaries.""
  - ""To study burglars' target choices, we apply the discrete choice framework to burglary location choices, an approach introduced in criminology by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta (2005).""
  - ""We estimate three main effects models to determine the effects of neighborhood and residence attributes on target choice.""
  - ""In addition, we estimate 25 cross-level interaction effect models to determine to which extent the relationships between residential attributes and the likelihood of burglary target selection vary according to neighborhood-level attributes.""
  - ""The integrated main effects and the interaction effects models are most relevant for our argument.""
  - ""Table 3 displays estimated odds ratios (OR) and standard errors (SE) as well as the Akaike (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to assess relative model fit for the integrated main effects only model.""
  - ""First, we assess relative model fit for the main effects only models (see Table 3 and Appendix Table 6""
  - ""The smallest AIC and BIC values are observed for the integrated main effects model.""
  - ""We begin by evaluating the role of neighborhood attributes in burglars' target selection process.""
  - ""As shown in Table 3 , residential density and prior burglary activity in the same neighborhood are significantly related to the likelihood of a residence being burglarized, while median income, proportion non-Belgians, and proportion rental units are not.""
  - ""Three out of four residential features are significantly associated with burglary target selection.""
  - ""burglars prefer renter-occupied residences.""
  - ""Finally, with respect to distance our results confirm that burglars have a preference for burglarizing residences nearby their home address, a finding that has been demonstrated repeatedly in prior research (Ruiter 2017).""
  - ""Table 4 summarizes the results of the 25 tests in terms of statistical significance.""
  - ""Complete numerical results are displayed in Appendix Tables 5, 6 , 7, 8, 9 and 10, while a graphical presentation of the significant interactions is provided in Appendix Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14""
  - ""The top panel of the figure shows how the effect size of distance (in kilometers) varies across neighborhood median income levels (in € 1000).""
  - ""The bottom panel displays the reverse projection of this interaction: it shows how the effect size of neighborhood median income varies across distance.""
  - ""By stating that the three most important aspects of real estate are ""location, location, and location"", many real estate advisors warn prospective buyers against a myopic focus on the individual property and urge them to carefully consider the property's surroundings.""
  - ""Based on the analysis of 679 cleared burglaries committed by 577 burglars, our findings demonstrate that residential burglars adhere to this advice as well.""
  - ""Their choice of targets appears to be informed by both house attributes and neighborhood attributes, and the evaluation of house attributes varies in relation to their neighborhood context.""
  - ""Our results carry implications for theory and research on offender spatial decision-making.""
  - ""In particular, the results of our study are important for how we should think about burglary target selection and, more generally, offender spatial decision-making.""
  - ""Our study opens up at least two avenues for future research.""
  - ""First, given the well-corroborated finding that burglary risk of a residence is heightened in the wake of a previous burglary (Ellingworth et al. 1995;Farrell and Pease 2001;Polvi et al. 1991), repeated victimization could be reflected in repeated targeting of the same residence by the same offenders.""
  - ""Second, future research could consider short-distance spatial spillover mechanisms in greater detail.""
  - ""In discussing the suggestions for future research, we have also touched upon the implications of our study results for crime prevention practice and crime control policy.""
  - ""If burglary victims protect themselves and improve household security after having been victimized, offenders who return to the same property may find the place better protected and target a nearby property instead.""
  - ""Ultimately, this may render preventative action collectively fruitless.""
  - ""At a practical level, this implies that preventative measures implemented in the wake of a burglary should neither be restricted to the recently targeted residence nor should they be taken in isolation of the neighborhood.""
  - ""Our finding that burglary risk is affected by both residence-level and neighborhood-level attributes underlines this, since it suggests that burglary prevention is optimized by a combination of private and collective efforts.""
  - ""Our findings show that detached residences, rented residences, and properties nearby the homes of burglars have an elevated risk of being targeted, and that the same holds true for low residential-density neighborhoods and neighborhoods recently targeted by burglars.""
  - ""Moreover, the effects of certain neighborhood and residential attributes appear to depend on each other, which could further indicate that individual preventative action may not be successful unless accompanying prevention measures are taken at the neighborhood level to remedy features outside the control of individual homeowners.""
  - ""Admittedly, the current indicators at both levels are too limited to suggest specific preventative actions or develop prevention strategies, in particular because they provide sparse evidence on the underlying mechanisms.""
  - ""Nonetheless, they highlight the dual-level nature of burglary spatial decision-making and stress the importance of residence and neighborhood features in the burglary problem.""
  - ""It is important to acknowledge that our research is subject to similar limitations as prior crime location choice studies, including that we assume that burglary trips start from the offender's home (Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta 2005;Townsley et al. 2015), that we analyzed co-offending burglaries separately as individual decisions (Bernasco et al. 2015), and that we assume that offenders have full information on all the alternatives and can discriminate between each of the 138,000 residences in the study area.""
  - ""This last assumption, in particular, becomes increasingly unsustainable as spatial units of analysis become more finegrained and choice sets grow dramatically in size (Ruiter 2017;Vandeviver 2015).""
  - ""Three additional qualifications, specific to this study, must be made.""
  - ""First, our findings rely solely on detected, reported, and cleared burglaries.""
  - ""In particular, a subset of burglars and burglaries was purposely selected to meet our study's criteria.""
  - ""Admittedly, this may bias our results if cleared burglaries are a non-probabilistic sample from all burglaries.""
  - ""While there is evidence to suggest that burglars who are caught in the act and who have their burglaries witnessed are more likely to be identified by the police (Coupe and Girling 2001;Coupe and Griffiths 1996), the same studies suggest that it is difficult to predict which burglars will be caught in the act or have their burglaries witnessed by bystanders.""
  - ""In addition, comparing identified and unidentified offenders from a DNA-database, Lammers (2014) established that spatial offending patterns for both groups were similar.""
  - ""Therefore, burglary clearance may be subject to sufficient randomness to consider cleared burglaries as a probabilistic sample of all burglaries that allows for tentative generalizations.""
  - ""Additional burglary selection criteria that we imposed may also bias our results.""
  - ""This is an undesirable but inevitable consequence of any approach that considers offender characteristics (e.g., prior offences) and offender-area interactions (e.g., distance between the offender's home and target), including the discrete spatial choice approach.""
  - ""However, alternative methodologies such as ethnography and offender interviews similarly suffer from non-probability biases, focusing strongly on prolific offenders (Townsley et al. 2015) or reporting on idiosyncratic events (Vandeviver et al. 2015a""
  - ""Second, Census data are not collected for scientific purposes and consequently do not contain all variables that are potentially relevant predictors for burglary target selection.""
  - ""Certain residential features, such as presence of an alarm, observability, and ease of entry or escape, but also situational cues, such as homeowner presence at the time of the burglary, could not be included in our analyses.""
  - ""In doing so, we may have inadvertently overestimated the effects of the included neighborhood and residence variables on burglary target selection.""
  - ""However, large-scale residence-level data are scarce and the scale of our study made systematically collecting residential features practically infeasible.""
  - ""Moreover, situational cues are important but such time-variable features are also difficult to measure reliably and are therefore excluded altogether from observational studies of burglary target selection (Langton and Steenbeek 2017;Peeters et al. 2017).""
  - ""While the omission of certain residential attributes is undesirable, this does not completely invalidate the results of our study.""
  - ""Our models include environmental features that are mostly stable over time and thus serve to illustrate how time-invariable features of neighborhoods and residences affect burglary target selection.""
  - ""Third, our neighborhood and residence data were not measured at the same time of the burglary.""
  - ""The burglary data span the period 2005-2014 but the neighborhood and residence data are for 2011 only.""
  - ""As a result, we cannot rule out that some of the neighborhood and residence features have changed since the time of the burglary.""
  - ""However, the majority of neighborhood and residential features included in the Census data are mostly stable over time and will likely not have changed since the burglary.""",,"- The study focuses on residential burglars' target selection in Ghent, Belgium, using a discrete spatial choice approach.
- The study combines data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods.

Extraction Confidence: High","  - ""Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives-crime pattern and social disorganization theories.""
  - ""In the present article, we examine spatial patterns of a high-volume acquisitive crime that has received little attention in the academic literature-theft from vehicle (TVF)and do so using a discrete spatial choice approach (McFadden, 1973).""
  - ""Data for crimes detected by the police were acquired for the county of Dorset (UK) for the 5-year period January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2005.""
  - ""The unit of analysis selected was the U.K. census Lower Super Output Area (LSOA). For the study area, there were 198 LSOAs, each with a population of around 1,524 people and about 662 residential households.""
  - ""A total of 721 crimes committed by 263 offenders were included in the analyses.""
  - ""The dependency in the data associated with reoffending has the potential to lead to errors of statistical inference.""
  - ""The type of model used, also referred to as a random utility model (for an overview, see Train, 2003), assumes that when making a decision, a chooser (in this case an offender) selects from a set of alternatives the choice that maximizes their perceived utility.""
  - ""The influence of the road network on adult offender spatial decision making is a particularly novel result and this finding, along with those concerned with the impact of routine activity nodes on offender spatial decision making, has potential policy implications for those involved in the development of urban spaces.""
  - ""The fact that younger offenders did not appear to exhibit a preference for targeting areas that were closer to the city center, but appeared to prefer those located further away is a potentially puzzling finding.""
  - ""In line with social disorganization theory, it appears that offenders were more likely to target those areas in which residents have the least potential to form social ties, either because population turnover is relatively high, or because the residents come from different socioeconomic backgrounds (or both).""
  - ""using a discrete choice approach, the present study provides further evidence to support crime pattern and social disorganization theory in explaining offender spatial decision making.""
  - ""The present study demonstrates that this is true for a type of crime not studied previously, and for a geographical location not studied elsewhere, thereby extending the external validity of the research base and demonstrating the generality of these theories at explaining the distribution of different types of crime.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=16 table_on_page=1>```

Missing Information: None explicitly mentioned
Extraction Confidence: High","  - ""Using data on residential burglaries and residential burglars in The Hague, this study addresses the issue of whether solitary offenders choose their target areas differently from the way offender groups do.""
  - ""The results support the postulated relevance of physical accessibility and proximity to the offenders' homes for both single offenders and co-offending groups.""
  - ""The detection rate for residential burglary in The Hague is 7%.""
  - ""To test the hypotheses, data were used that pertain to all detected residential burglaries committed by burglars living in the city of The Hague, the Netherlands, in the period 1996-2004.""
  - ""The Hague comprises of 89 residential neighbourhoods.""
  - ""The average neighbourhood has an area of 0.65 square kilometres, is the home to 4952 residents and contains 2380 residential units.""
  - ""Data on residential burglaries were obtained from the police force that services the greater The Hague area.""
  - ""The unique crime incident number links offenders who have been involved in the same incident.""
  - ""From the police records, all persons who had been arrested at least once for being involved in a residential burglary during the years 1996-2004 were selected (n = 1974).""
  - ""For each burglar-burglary combination, the distance between the offender home and the crime site was calculated using the centroids of both neighbourhoods.""
  - ""The outcomes of estimating the choice model are presented in Table 8""
  - ""The second major column of the Table, titled 'solitary offender', contains the results of a conditional logit model of neighbourhood target choice by solitary burglars.""
  - ""The third column applies to offender groups.""
  - ""The parameter estimates are multiplicative in the (conditional) probability that a neighbourhood is chosen as a target area for a burglary.""
  - ""The presented estimated standard errors are 'robust' standard errors that have been upwardly corrected to account for the dependence between observations that emerges because some offender's and some offender groups' multiple burglaries are analysed""
  - ""To answer the first research question that refers to the criteria residential burglars use for selecting target areas, we assess the direction and magnitude of the effects of these criteria in the second and third columns of Table 8 ('solitary offender' and 'offender group').""
  - ""The results partially support the hypotheses, because the effects of physical accessibility, proximity, and a special proximity aspect, the home neighbourhood, are all significant in the hypothesised direction, supporting hypotheses 2 and 4.""
  - ""The hypotheses 1, 3, and 5, however, are not supported, as the effects of affluence, social disorganisation, and proximity to the city centre, are not significant.""
  - ""Apparently there is a strong preference for the own neighbourhood as burglary target area.""
  - ""Hypotheses 5-10 refer to the second research question, which is the question whether solitary burglars and burglar groups differ in terms of the criteria used for choosing target areas.""
  - ""The tests have been performed on all parameters, even if they were not significant in the separate models, because in principle, parameter estimates can differ significantly when both estimates separately do not differ significantly from 1.""
  - ""Except for the fact that solitary offenders appear to have a stronger preference for searching a burglary target in their own neighbourhood, there are no significant differences.""
  - ""Apparently, although the burglary act could be quite different for solitary individuals and groups, both seem to agree on the criteria that are important for choosing a target area.""
  - ""These criteria are proximity-with a special emphasis on the own home neighbourhood as an attractive target area-and the physical accessibility of the properties in the area.""
  - ""The outcomes thus partially confirm the general theory on burglary target area choice, but they refute the postulated differences between solitary offenders and group offenders.""
  - ""Most importantly, the results confirm the importance of the neighbourhood environment as a burglary target area for local offenders.""
  - ""The own neighbourhood and other nearby neighbourhoods are the most likely targets for burglary, not only for solitary burglars, but for burglar groups as well.""
  - ""Another criterion that appears to drive the target areas choice of burglars is the physical accessibility of the properties in the area.""
  - ""Neighbourhoods characterised by a low percentage of terraced properties and a high percentage of single family houses are the most popular target neighbourhoods, again both for solitary burglars and for burglar groups.""
  - ""Like Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta (2005), we do not find confirmation of the hypothesis that affluent neighbourhoods are popular target areas for burglary.""
  - ""After controlling for distance and 'own neighbourhood', we find no evidence that socially disorganised neighbourhoods attract burglars.""
  - ""The low detection rate could bias the results if a relationship exists between criteria of location choice and the probability of arrest.""
  - ""Separate analyses, however, show no systematic relationship between neighbourhood characteristics and burglary detection rates.""",,"- The study focuses on residential burglaries in The Hague, Netherlands, using data from 1996 to 2004.
- The study area consists of 89 residential neighborhoods with an average area of 0.65 square kilometers and a population of approximately 4,952 residents per neighborhood.
- The data source is primarily from police records, with a detection rate of 7% for residential burglaries.
- The study uses a conditional logit model to analyze the choice of target areas by solitary offenders and offender groups.
- The results indicate that physical accessibility and proximity to the offenders' homes are significant factors for both solitary and group offenders.
- There is a strong preference for targeting neighborhoods close to the offenders' homes, especially for solitary offenders.
- The study finds no significant differences in target area selection criteria between solitary and group offenders, except for a stronger preference for own neighborhood targets among solitary offenders.
- The study does not support hypotheses related to affluence, social disorganization, and proximity to the city center as significant factors.
- The study suggests that both solitary and group offenders prioritize proximity and physical accessibility when choosing target areas."

Extraction Confidence: High","  - ""Using data in 3,337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before.""
  - ""Data were acquired for all detected residential burglaries committed between January 2007 and December 2012 in the West Midlands, a large metropolitan UK police force""
  - ""A residential burglary is the actual or attempted illegal entry into a dwelling with the intent to steal""
  - ""The following variables were available for analysis for each burglary: a unique identifier for the offender involved; the time and date of the burglary; the address and geographic grid coordinates of the burglary (accurate to a resolution of one meter); and spatial coordinates for the home address of the offender at the time of the burglary (also accurate to a resolution of one meter).""
  - ""To prevent a temporal edge effect it was necessary to assure that for each burglary the data would allow us to look back over a fixed period of time to establish the offender's previous burglaries.""
  - ""The data for the remaining observation period (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) were used to analyze their subsequent burglary location choices.""
  - ""A period of 2 years was chosen in part because a longer period of 'historic' burglaries would imply a lower number of focal burglaries to be analyzed (and thus lower statistical power), and was also in line with the length of the periods selected in related studies on the role of former offender residences (Bernasco, 2010b) and former crime locations (Lammers et al., 2015) in crime location choice.""
  - ""The concept of crime location choice presumes spatial units of analysis, which are the alternative locations that burglars choose from when deciding on where to commit a burglary.""
  - ""As a compromise, we decided to use the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) geography as the basic spatial unit of analysis.""
  - ""LSOAs are defined on the basis of proximity and social homogeneity measures (type of dwelling and nature of tenure) and have a population of approximately 1,500 residents and 600 households.""
  - ""Spillover effects can be assessed using either hierarchical spatial nesting structures or spatial proximity structures (Bernasco & Elffers, 2010).""
  - ""To test the hypotheses, a discrete spatial crime location choice approach is used (Bernasco et al., 2013;Bernasco & Ruiter, 2014) in which every burglary is conceptualized as a discrete choice amongst all 1,687 LSOAs in the study area, and a multinomial logit model is used to estimate the relative weight of each of the LSOA characteristics in the burglar's decision.""
  - ""The estimated model parameters (odds ratios, confidence intervals, and significance level indicators) are listed in Table A1 in the Appendix.""
  - ""Pseudo R 2 values for the discrete choice model are expected to be much lower than those for ordinary least squares models. In this case, according to McFadden's guidance, the observed pseudo R 2 of .31 represents an excellent fit to the data (McFadden, 1978: 307)""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=25 table_on_page=1>```markdown

  - ""the data analysed are reported, recorded, and detected crimes and this is not the case for all crimes.""
  - ""The sample of offenders and offences included in the analyses may therefore be biased in some way.""
  - ""The non-complete knowledge of offences may also be a particular issue here as the analysis assumes the offenders with one offence in the time-period are not repeat offenders.""
  - ""In this analysis a range of offence types were grouped together. While the offence choice criteria are expected to similarly effect the different types of offenders and this approach has been used in other analysis (e.g. Bernasco, 2010;Lammers et al., 2015), it ignores that some types of offenders may behave differently with respect to these factors.""",,"REASONING:

- The study is conducted in York, UK, covering an area of approximately 270 km². This information is crucial for understanding the geographic scope of the study.
- The data used in the study includes 1,105 recorded and solved serious acquisitive crimes (SAC) committed by 687 offenders between April 2008 and March 2012. This provides the temporal scope and the sample size of the study.
- The data includes offenders' home and offence locations, as well as demographic information such as date of birth and gender. This indicates the type of data collected and its granularity.
- The study uses discrete choice models, specifically computed in Stata 14, indicating the software and methodological approach used.
- The data is based on reported, recorded, and detected crimes, which may introduce bias as not all crimes are reported or detected. This highlights a limitation in the data quality.
- The study groups various types of offences together, which may affect the analysis as different types of offenders might behave differently. This is a methodological consideration that could impact the findings."

- The data collection involved counting graffiti items and measuring street network centrality, with a focus on public facilities that attract crowds.
- The study uses a discrete spatial choice model, specifically the conditional logit model, to analyze the factors influencing graffiti location choices.
- The spatial unit of analysis is street segments, with a total of 2,233 segments analyzed.
- The study area is limited to Ghent's city center, with no data collected on railway tracks or trains.
- The study identifies several significant predictors of graffiti location choices, including street network centrality, bars, night shops, residential units, and schools.
- The study also notes the preference for bridges over intersections and regular street segments due to their high exposure and uninterrupted canvas.
- The data quality is assessed using Krippendorff's alpha coefficient, with variables below a certain threshold excluded from the analysis."

  - ""An increase in distance from the terrorist's home to the attack site decreased the likelihood that an area would be chosen and an area was more likely to be chosen if it contained a major road, police station or military base.""
  - ""The final offence and offender datasets comprised 150 attacks by 127 PIRA members within Belfast.""
  - ""The location of each attack was geocoded to the corresponding SA.""
  - ""The discrete spatial choice approach concerns an individual's choice between a set of two or more discrete alternatives, based on the utility they expect to derive from each alternative""
  - ""the set of alternatives takes the form of SAs in Belfast, Northern

- The primary crime type analyzed is residential burglary, with data collected on 650 burglaries and approximately 500,000 residential properties.
- The study uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze burglary target selection, focusing on house-related attributes.
- The data sources include the Belgian Federal Police for crime data and the Belgian Land Registry for residential property data.
- The spatial unit of analysis is the individual house, which is a novel approach compared to previous studies that used larger spatial units like neighborhoods.
- The study period is not explicitly mentioned, but the Belgian Land Registry data reflects the situation as of January 1, 2013.
- The statistical method used is a conditional logit model, and the software used for analysis is R, run on a high-performance computing infrastructure.
- The study finds that houses are less likely to be burglarized if they are semi-detached, have a garage, or are outfitted with central heating/air-conditioning. Distance from the offender's home is also a significant factor, with the likelihood of burglary decreasing as distance increases."

Extraction Confidence: High","  - ""Collecting fresh, micro-level data using Google Street View (GSV) as a tool of Systematic Social Observation (SSO), we utilise a case-control design to isolate property-level effects.""
  - ""The ease of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are all positively related to burglary risk.""
  - ""There is no evidence that indications of resident wealth are related to the likelihood of victimisation, or that the effect of surveillability varies depending on the extent of collective efficacy in a neighbourhood.""
  - ""the study considers whether the effects of these property-level attributes vary depending on the neighbourhood in which residences are nested.""
  - ""The outcome variable in this study was whether or not a residential unit was burgled in The Hague during the year 2009.""
  - ""The explanatory variables on the property-level were primarily collected based a variety of GSV images, which allows users to 'move' up and down the street to get different angles of the property, including nearby streets from which the unit is visible.""
  - ""Property surveillability was measured by three items, namely (1) the number of windows from neighbouring residential units with a direct view of the front ground floor, (2) the distance between the property and the building on the other side of the street, and (3) the visibility of the front door from the street.""
  - ""Property accessibility was measured through seven items, namely (1) whether the property was at the end of a row of properties, (2) number of boundaries the property shared with public areas, (3) whether the private space of the property could be sealed off with physical barriers, (4) whether the property has a burglar alarm, (5) whether the property was setback from the street, (6) the age of the building and ( 7) whether the property had amenities, such as plant pots and benches, on public space directly outside the unit.""
  - ""Wealth was measured with three items, namely (1) whether the property had a garage, (2) the size of the property in square metres, and (3) the external condition of the property.""
  - ""Ease of escape was measured with three items, namely (1) the distance between the property and the nearest main road, (2) the distance between the property and the nearest street corner, and (3) the number of escape routes, including footpaths, leading off the street segment.""
  - ""Three variables were used as control variables. One binary variable indicated whether there was a business present in the immediate surrounding area open during daylight hours: we aimed to control for the 'eyes on the street' that nearby businesses might generate. Mixed land-use was a binary variable indicating whether the immediate surrounding area had land usage beyond that of purely residential, such as a car park.
